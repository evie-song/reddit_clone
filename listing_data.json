On one hand, American Chinese food has been looked down on for a very long time due to the perception that it is greasy, sketchy, unhealthy, etc. A lot of second gen Chinese Americans might feel ashamed to be associated with this kind of food, so they overcompensate by going on full board with the authenticity train- trying hard to prove that Chinese food is more than just the takeout menu.

Some will return after 48 hours: others will go away *permanently* unless the issue is adequately addressed, since many moderators aren't able to put in the work they do with the poor tools available through the official app. This isn't something any of us do lightly: we do what we do because *we love Reddit*, and we truly believe this change will make it impossible to keep doing what we love.\n\nThe two-day blackout isn't the *goal*, and it isn't the end. Should things reach the 14th with no sign of Reddit choosing to fix what they've broken, we'll use the community and buzz we've built between then and now as a tool for further action.\n\nWhat can *you* do?\n\n1. **Complain.** Message the mods of /r/reddit.com, who are the admins of the site: message /u/reddit: submit a [support request](https://support.reddithelp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new): comment in relevant threads on /r/reddit, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/.), leave a negative review on their official iOS or Android app- and sign your username in support to this post.\n\n2. **Spread the word.** Rabble-rouse on related subreddits.

        "selftext": "**Black lives matter.** The moderation team at AskScience wants to express our outrage and sadness at the systemic racism and disproportionate violence experienced by the black community. This has gone on for too long, and it's time for lasting change. \n\nWhen 1 out of every 1,000 black men and boys in the United States can expect to be killed by the police, police violence is a public health crisis. Black men are about 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men. In 2019, 1,099 people were killed by police in the US; 24% of those were black, even though only 13% of the population is black.\n\nWhen black Americans make up a disproportionate number of COVID-19 deaths, healthcare disparity is another public health crisis. In Michigan, black people make up 14% of the population and 40% of COVID-19 deaths. In Louisiana, black people are 33% of the population but account for 70% of COVID-19 deaths. Black Americans are more likely to work in essential jobs, with 38% of black workers employed in these industries compared with 29% of white workers. They are less likely to have access to health insurance and more likely to lack continuity in medical care.\n\nThese disparities, these crises, are not coincidental. They are the result of systemic racism, economic inequality, and oppression. \n\nChange requires us to look inward, too. For over a decade, AskScience has been a forum where redditors can discuss scientific topics with scientists. Our panel includes hundreds of STEM professionals who volunteer their time, and we are proud to be an interface between scientists and non-scientists. We are fully committed to making science more accessible, and we hope it inspires people to consider careers in STEM. \n\nHowever, we must acknowledge that STEM suffers from a marked lack of diversity. In the US, black workers comprise 11% of the US workforce, but hold just 7% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. Only 4% of medical doctors are black. Hispanic workers make up 16% of the US workforce, 6% of STEM jobs that require a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher, and 4.4% of medical doctors. Women make up 47% of the US workforce but 41% of STEM professionals with professional or doctoral degrees. And while we know around 3.5% of the US workforce identifies as LGBTQ+, their representation in STEM fields is largely unknown.\n\nThese numbers become even more dismal in certain disciplines. For example, as of 2019, less than 4% of tenured or tenure-track geoscience positions are held by people of color, and fewer than 100 black women in the US have received PhDs in physics.\n\nThis lack of diversity is unacceptable and actively harmful, both to people who are not afforded opportunities they deserve and to the STEM community as a whole. We cannot truly say we have cultivated the best and brightest in our respective fields when we are missing the voices of talented, brilliant people who are held back by widespread racism, sexism, and homophobia.\n\nIt is up to us to confront these systemic injustices directly. We must all stand together against police violence, racism, and economic, social, and environmental inequality. STEM professional need to make sure underrepresented voices are heard, to listen, and to offer support. We must be the change. \n\n-----\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793\n- https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/\n- https://labblog.uofmhealth.org/rounds/racial-disparities-time-of-covid-19\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK24693/\n- https://www.joincampaignzero.org/research\n- https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/black-workers-coronavirus-covid-19\n- https://www.npr.org/transcripts/867466515\n- https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2018/01/09/diversity-in-the-stem-workforce-varies-widely-across-jobs/\n- https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-019-0519-z\n- https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.6.3.20190529a/full/\n- https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/09/11/even-progressive-academics-can-be-racist-ive-experienced-it-firsthand/\n- http://www.bu.edu/articles/2017/lgbt-issues-stem-diversity/",

We are *very* excited about the upcoming press release (10:30 EST / 15:30 UTC) from the [LIGO](http://www.ligo.org) collaboration, a ground-based experiment to detect gravitational waves. This thread will be edited as updates become available. We'll have a number of panelists in and out (who will also be listening in), so please ask questions!\n\n-----\n\nLinks:\n\n* [YouTube Announcement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7293kAiPZw)\n* [LIGO](http://www.ligo.org/news/media-advisory.php)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by Discovery](http://news.discovery.com/space/what-you-need-to-know-about-gravitational-waves-160210.htm)\n* [Gravitational wave primer by PhD Comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1853)\n\n-----\n\nFAQ:\n\n> Where do they come from?\n\nThe source of gravitational waves detectable by human experiments are two compact objects orbiting around each other. LIGO observes stellar mass objects (some combination of neutron stars and black holes, for example) orbiting around each other just before they merge (as gravitational wave energy leaves the system, the orbit shrinks). \n\n> How fast do they go?\n\nGravitational waves travel at the speed of light ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_gravity)).\n\n> Haven't gravitational waves already been detected?\n\nThe 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for the *indirect* detection of gravitational waves from a double neutron star system, [PSR B1913+16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSR_B1913%2B16).\n\nIn 2014, the [BICEP2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BICEP_and_Keck_Array#BICEP2) team announced the detection of primordial gravitational waves, or those from the very early universe and inflation. A joint analysis of the cosmic microwave background maps from the Planck and BICEP2 team in January 2015 showed that the signal they detected could be attributed entirely to foreground dust in the Milky Way.\n\n> Does this mean we can control gravity?\n\nNo. More precisely, many things will emit gravitational waves, but they will be so incredibly weak that they are immeasurable. It takes very massive, compact objects to produce already tiny strains. For more information on the expected spectrum of gravitational waves, see [here](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/gwave_spectrum.html).\n\n> What's the practical application?\n\n[Here](http://stuver.blogspot.com/2012/01/q-how-can-gravitational-waves-help.html) is a nice and concise review.\n\n> How is this consistent with the idea of gravitons? Is this gravitons?\n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/44ht2f/if_the_rumor_of_gravitational_waves_is_confirmed/czqa5bv) is a recent /r/askscience discussion answering just that!

My son has been doing this \"indecisive\" thing since before he could talk (he is 3 now).\n\nBasically he can't make a decision and throws a fit about ANY options I give him and I end up having to make decisions for him because no matter which decision I make, he's gonna throw a fit either way.\n\nFor example when he was a baby, his 2 favorite foods were bananas and peas. I would show him the containers and ask which one he wanted and let's say he pointed to peas. I would start to open the peas and he would start crying and point to the bananas. So I would grab the bananas and start opening them and he would cry and point to the peas. And this would just go back and forth until I eventually made a decision for him and he would just throw a big old fit about whatever option I chose. \n\nA more recent example from today. I asked him if he wanted to come with me to pick up his sister from school. At first he said yes, but then we got to the door and he whined \"I wanna stay with daddy!\" So I said \"Okay, see you in a minute!\" And started to walk out the door then he yelled \"I WANNA COME WITH YOU!\" So I said \"Okay, let's go!\" And he just kept going back and forth until I made the decision for him and he threw a huge fit about it.\n\nThis happens ALL THE TIME.

        "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I am hoping for some positive parenting advice on something. My son has been doing this &quot;indecisive&quot; thing since before he could talk (he is 3 now).</p>\n\n<p>Basically he can&#39;t make a decision and throws a fit about ANY options I give him and I end up having to make decisions for him because no matter which decision I make, he&#39;s gonna throw a fit either way.</p>\n\n<p>For example when he was a baby, his 2 favorite foods were bananas and peas. I would show him the containers and ask which one he wanted and let&#39;s say he pointed to peas. I would start to open the peas and he would start crying and point to the bananas. So I would grab the bananas and start opening them and he would cry and point to the peas. And this would just go back and forth until I eventually made a decision for him and he would just throw a big old fit about whatever option I chose. </p>\n\n<p>A more recent example from today. I asked him if he wanted to come with me to pick up his sister from school. At first he said yes, but then we got to the door and he whined &quot;I wanna stay with daddy!&quot; So I said &quot;Okay, see you in a minute!&quot; And started to walk out the door then he yelled &quot;I WANNA COME WITH YOU!&quot; So I said &quot;Okay, let&#39;s go!&quot; And he just kept going back and forth until I made the decision for him and he threw a huge fit about it.</p>\n\n<p>This happens ALL THE TIME.

We started potty training about 3 weeks ago and adopted a gentle/positive approach. We started with him being naked from the waist down for the first 2 days and on day 3 introduced pants then trousers. Any time he had an accident we didn\u2019t make a big deal about it and just cleaned it up. He started announcing when he needed a pee and would go happily in either the toilet or the potty. \n\nQuite quickly after we started potty training, he did a poo a few times on the potty and was very distressed. I think he has associated the potty with pain as one time my mum told me she encouraged him on to the potty (before we properly started training) and he was constipated. This then lead to him holding on to his poos. As soon as I realised this I started giving him prunes and making sure he drank a lot of water so he didn\u2019t become constipated. At the time I thought he would realise it didn\u2019t hurt and this should help him, however he was still very distressed when he went (despite not being constipated). We then decided to let him poo in a nappy as he was so scared to do it anywhere else. This has been the case for a few weeks now. \n\nA few days ago, he began refusing to wear pants completely and kept asking for a nappy saying he needed a poo and gets very upset if we try to take it off. For the past 2 days he has been in nappies the whole day, although we are gently encouraging him to try the toilet/potty and to wear pants but just back off when he says no.\n\nI have looked into some self help CBT methods (graded exposure) for overcoming toilet anxiety and plan to do this with him. I\u2019m wondering if I should just stop the potty training until I have done this. What does everyone else think? \n\nThanks!",

        "selftext": "Finding-moments.com/resources\n\n**LENELL**\n\nRecently I have noticed that my teenage daughter has developed a ninja-like skill where I turn around and she is no longer in the room.\u00a0 Typically, she is found in her bedroom texting a friend, reading a book, or drawing.\u00a0 The activities are not concerning except they don\u2019t include me! Now I find myself trying to figure out how to draw out our exchanges to keep her engaged with me.\u00a0 My jokes aren\u2019t funny anymore, my concern is now perceived as annoying, and I\u2019m often accused of poking her when I just am trying to reach out for affection.\u00a0 Rationally I know it is part of being a teenager and I know I am officially in the same boat with other parents of teenagers \u2013 exiled to the little life raft and not allowed in on the fun and games happening on the cruise ship.\u00a0 My daughter and I have always been close, and it is something I really value as a parent.\u00a0 It gives me security to know she will come to me and talk to me if she needs support.\u00a0 More than anything, I don\u2019t want to lose that connection.\n\nSo, what does being connected to your children mean?\u00a0 There is the togetherness of being in the same room watching a show, there is the togetherness you experience playing a board game, then there are those moments of meaningful conversation.\u00a0 Teenagers value their privacy so it is easy for general parent enquiries to be misinterpreted as opening interrogation techniques.\u00a0 You may get the one word response that seems to be a teen\u2019s foolproof way to terminate any discourse.\u00a0 This past week there was a heavier homework load, and I realized a simple routine event was missing.\u00a0 Normally we cook dinner together.\u00a0 It allows us to be engaged in an activity where we both rely on each other to achieve an end goal.\u00a0 I know its only dinner, but it\u2019s true!\u00a0 We have to communicate and work together.\u00a0 In between we joke around, make comments about our day, sometimes listen to a podcast, and discuss our viewpoints.\u00a0 It\u2019s a sustained interaction and she doesn\u2019t feel she is under the spotlight because we have a shared activity we are focused on.\u00a0 Even better, we all have to eat so it\u2019s not like I suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s play a card game!\u201d which may or may not elicit eye rolls or rejection.\u00a0 \n\nI know it is going to be different as she grows up.\u00a0 She is going to want to share experiences with her friends and I won\u2019t always get to do everything with her.\u00a0 I can have a consistent connection by making the most out of our daily routines and being actively present.\u00a0 Next up, French toast for breakfast!\n\n**TRISHA**\n\nI think we have the exact opposite situation with our 7 year old \u2026 ***He\u2019s ALWAYS THERE!***\n\nDifferent stages of a kid\u2019s life bring different challenges, that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0 And different aspects of that stage tend to drive you crazy!\u00a0 He\u2019s first up every morning, and even though he doesn\u2019t have an alarm clock, he pops into our room the instant we sit up.\u00a0 (I mean, the same instant\u2026it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s watching us!\u00a0 Through two walls!)\u00a0 He rarely spends *any* time in *any* room by himself, and makes \u201cthe sad face\u201d if we ever have meetings or phone calls we have to take while he\u2019s home and awake.\u00a0 This past year has certainly brought a new dynamic to the schedule.\u00a0 Our school district has flipped back and forth between in-person and online learning, and that\u2019s been a huge challenge for him.\u00a0 Right now, he\u2019s back in the building 4 days a week and it makes all the difference for him, AND us.\u00a0 Just that slight bit of separation give us parents just enough breathing room to gear up for the next round.\u00a0 He\u2019s always been an \u201cintense\u201d kid, needing and demanding a lot of attention from everyone in the family.\u00a0 Which isn\u2019t a bad thing, by any means, just overwhelming sometimes.\u00a0 I still sometimes feel that \u201cdon\u2019t touch me!\u201d feeling that permeates the baby and toddler years!\n\nEventually, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll reach LenEll\u2019s perspective, and it will be even more profound with our last child.\u00a0 Our oldest will be off to college when this guy is only in eighth grade, and that will be an adjustment for all of us.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll miss the time spent on the reading log minutes and the school project of the moment (this week it\u2019s the Valentine\u2019s cards and mailbox). I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever miss a 6:30 am wake up/welcome, but the seven year old hugs are the best.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have to make sure we actively pursue time together as he gets older.\n\n**CHAD**\n\nOur 12 year old has a couple of really great friends.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t a day that he wouldn\u2019t rather spend his free time hanging on the deck (masked and distanced) with them instead of us.\u00a0 That\u2019s ok.\u00a0 There is more flexibility needed now more than ever.\u00a0 The challenge is time management on his part, and seeing him find every way imaginable to zone out of our real world for a virtual one.\u00a0 Air pods, iPad, video games are preferred to living in the reality zone of our family room.\u00a0 \n\nAs a dad, I try to pick my moments.\u00a0 One is chess.\u00a0 He won the other night for the first time!\u00a0 The game is a rite of passage - it is a game I enjoyed playing with my dad growing up.\u00a0 Another moment is throwing the football, or playing a game of hoops to 11.\u00a0 Emerging skills, but it\u2019s relaxing, non-screen time and allows for very real conversations.\u00a0 When exerting physical energy, neither of us have time to really pause and think, we just simply talk and listen.\u00a0 While I favor pulling him away from a screen at any opportunity, especially in a virtual learning world, I also try to find the moments that meet his interests.\u00a0 Movies, bike rides, and yes \u2026 playing video games (so rough \ud83d\ude09)\n\nI am pretty tough on him.\u00a0 He has his chores, homework to do, and he has to set aside time to spend with his little brother.\u00a0 I sat down to help him set a schedule in his calendar app.\u00a0 It was a bit of a moment for him when he saw his commitments laid out hour by hour on a 7 day view.\u00a0 I was surprised at how well he adopted the idea and all of a sudden, his stress level went down.\u00a0 The garbage was taken out without asking. \u00a0His trumpet has made an appearance for practice.\u00a0 I see him working out 3-4 days a week for 15 minutes on his own.\u00a0 He is starting to develop an awareness of the need to balance his time.\u00a0 Since I was shocked at how scheduled he was already, we agreed that he needed time to play chess with Dad and to have quiet, non-screen time; so his bedtime pushed back by an hour to give him some breathing room.\u00a0 \n\nThere is no playbook right now.\u00a0 I firmly believe that quantity time does not mean quality.\u00a0 I try to go for the simple moments that we both will remember and to make sure to stay engaged as best I can with where he is at.\u00a0",

Now I find myself trying to figure out how to draw out our exchanges to keep her engaged with me.\u00a0 My jokes aren\u2019t funny anymore, my concern is now perceived as annoying, and I\u2019m often accused of poking her when I just am trying to reach out for affection.\u00a0 Rationally I know it is part of being a teenager and I know I am officially in the same boat with other parents of teenagers \u2013 exiled to the little life raft and not allowed in on the fun and games happening on the cruise ship.\u00a0 My daughter and I have always been close, and it is something I really value as a parent.\u00a0 It gives me security to know she will come to me and talk to me if she needs support.\u00a0 More than anything, I don\u2019t want to lose that connection.</p>\n\n<p>So, what does being connected to your children mean?\u00a0 There is the togetherness of being in the same room watching a show, there is the togetherness you experience playing a board game, then there are those moments of meaningful conversation.\u00a0 Teenagers value their privacy so it is easy for general parent enquiries to be misinterpreted as opening interrogation techniques.\u00a0 You may get the one word response that seems to be a teen\u2019s foolproof way to terminate any discourse.\u00a0 This past week there was a heavier homework load, and I realized a simple routine event was missing.\u00a0 Normally we cook dinner together.\u00a0 It allows us to be engaged in an activity where we both rely on each other to achieve an end goal.\u00a0 I know its only dinner, but it\u2019s true!\u00a0 We have to communicate and work together.\u00a0 In between we joke around, make comments about our day, sometimes listen to a podcast, and discuss our viewpoints.\u00a0 It\u2019s a sustained interaction and she doesn\u2019t feel she is under the spotlight because we have a shared activity we are focused on.\u00a0 Even better, we all have to eat so it\u2019s not like I suggested, \u201cLet\u2019s play a card game!\u201d which may or may not elicit eye rolls or rejection.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>I know it is going to be different as she grows up.\u00a0 She is going to want to share experiences with her friends and I won\u2019t always get to do everything with her.\u00a0 I can have a consistent connection by making the most out of our daily routines and being actively present.\u00a0 Next up, French toast for breakfast!</p>\n\n<p><strong>TRISHA</strong></p>\n\n<p>I think we have the exact opposite situation with our 7 year old \u2026 <strong><em>He\u2019s ALWAYS THERE!</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Different stages of a kid\u2019s life bring different challenges, that\u2019s for sure.\u00a0 And different aspects of that stage tend to drive you crazy!\u00a0 He\u2019s first up every morning, and even though he doesn\u2019t have an alarm clock, he pops into our room the instant we sit up.\u00a0 (I mean, the same instant\u2026it\u2019s almost like he\u2019s watching us!\u00a0 Through two walls!)\u00a0 He rarely spends <em>any</em> time in <em>any</em> room by himself, and makes \u201cthe sad face\u201d if we ever have meetings or phone calls we have to take while he\u2019s home and awake.\u00a0 This past year has certainly brought a new dynamic to the schedule.\u00a0 Our school district has flipped back and forth between in-person and online learning, and that\u2019s been a huge challenge for him.\u00a0 Right now, he\u2019s back in the building 4 days a week and it makes all the difference for him, AND us.\u00a0 Just that slight bit of separation give us parents just enough breathing room to gear up for the next round.\u00a0 He\u2019s always been an \u201cintense\u201d kid, needing and demanding a lot of attention from everyone in the family.\u00a0 Which isn\u2019t a bad thing, by any means, just overwhelming sometimes.\u00a0 I still sometimes feel that \u201cdon\u2019t touch me!\u201d feeling that permeates the baby and toddler years!</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll reach LenEll\u2019s perspective, and it will be even more profound with our last child.\u00a0 Our oldest will be off to college when this guy is only in eighth grade, and that will be an adjustment for all of us.\u00a0 I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll miss the time spent on the reading log minutes and the school project of the moment (this week it\u2019s the Valentine\u2019s cards and mailbox). I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll ever miss a 6:30 am wake up/welcome, but the seven year old hugs are the best.\u00a0 We\u2019ll have to make sure we actively pursue time together as he gets older.</p>\n\n<p><strong>CHAD</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our 12 year old has a couple of really great friends.\u00a0 There isn\u2019t a day that he wouldn\u2019t rather spend his free time hanging on the deck (masked and distanced) with them instead of us.\u00a0 That\u2019s ok.\u00a0 There is more flexibility needed now more than ever.\u00a0 The challenge is time management on his part, and seeing him find every way imaginable to zone out of our real world for a virtual one.\u00a0 Air pods, iPad, video games are preferred to living in the reality zone of our family room.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>As a dad, I try to pick my moments.\u00a0 One is chess.\u00a0 He won the other night for the first time!\u00a0 The game is a rite of passage - it is a game I enjoyed playing with my dad growing up.\u00a0 Another moment is throwing the football, or playing a game of hoops to 11.\u00a0 Emerging skills, but it\u2019s relaxing, non-screen time and allows for very real conversations.\u00a0 When exerting physical energy, neither of us have time to really pause and think, we just simply talk and listen.\u00a0 While I favor pulling him away from a screen at any opportunity, especially in a virtual learning world, I also try to find the moments that meet his interests.\u00a0 Movies, bike rides, and yes \u2026 playing video games (so rough \ud83d\ude09)</p>\n\n<p>I am pretty tough on him.\u00a0 He has his chores, homework to do, and he has to set aside time to spend with his little brother.\u00a0 I sat down to help him set a schedule in his calendar app.\u00a0 It was a bit of a moment for him when he saw his commitments laid out hour by hour on a 7 day view.\u00a0 I was surprised at how well he adopted the idea and all of a sudden, his stress level went down.\u00a0 The garbage was taken out without asking. \u00a0His trumpet has made an appearance for practice.\u00a0 I see him working out 3-4 days a week for 15 minutes on his own.\u00a0 He is starting to develop an awareness of the need to balance his time.\u00a0 Since I was shocked at how scheduled he was already, we agreed that he needed time to play chess with Dad and to have quiet, non-screen time; so his bedtime pushed back by an hour to give him some breathing room.\u00a0 </p>\n\n<p>There is no playbook right now.\u00a0 I firmly believe that quantity time does not mean quality.\u00a0 I try to go for the simple moments that we both will remember and to make sure to stay engaged as best I can with where he is at.\u00a0</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Please remove if inappropriate!\n\n*Disclaimer: if you're a fan of TCB, please don't read this as a dig at you! I was just about implement the program myself before going another route, and I'm sure it would have ultimately worked. I'll never judge a single parent for their sleep training choices, this is just a vent about the hype.*\n\nSo anyway, here it is.\n\n**The cost is gross**\n\nThe cost of TCB is not just overpriced, its almost exploitative. Selling sleep-products to sleep-deprived people is often not a recipe for ethical business practices, and TCB is no exception. Yes, I've bought other overpriced shit for my baby, but I've rarely done so out of desperation and crumbling mental health.\n\nI won't even get started on the ABCs costing nearly $200, but the \"3-4 month\" guide is $40 for a PDF... that apparently you only get access to for 6 months?? I was partly spurred to write this rant after reading this post, where OP clarifies that she contacted customer service and they confirmed this policy was intentional. This level of greed is gross. Its a $40 PDF!!\n\n**The program is narrow**\n\nI've watched the whole ABCs program and read the accompanying guide. We all already know its Ferber. But I'm shocked at just how narrow the program is compared to other resources. Other resources will give you options. They'll talk about extinction, they'll talk about ways you can ease into sleep training, they'll talk about adapting for roomsharing and co-sleeping, they'll talk about continuing to night feed if you want.\n\nNot TCB. The vibe is very much \"sure, you can *try* to make changes, but then we can't guarantee *anything* will work, so we *strongly* recommend you follow this plan to the letter.\" I was already pretty suspicious about \"pop-ins\" (check-ins), I really didn't think they would work for my baby. I was also fine doing feedings 1-2 times a night, I just wanted LO to stop waking up 5 times a night. Roomsharing is also highly discouraged, but I didn't really want to move into the living room for 2 weeks.\n\nThis program would just not have worked for me, and there's not much information at all about what you're getting before you pay full price. I've also seen people asking on here whether they should get TCB for nap training when there is literally one video at the end of the whole thing about naps, which essentially boils down to \"now do the same for naps.\" Obviously people don't know entirely what they're getting when they pay for the program.\n\nI get it, there's a gold standard to the plan. Cara can't have a \"99% success rate\" of babies sleeping through the night if people are allowed to deviate from the gold standard, but if you're looking for various tips and options this program is not for you.\n\n**The format is... kind of dumb**\n\nI will try to contain my snarkiness... but what the heck are these acronyms? S.I.T.B.A.C.K.? C.U.T.F.E.E.D.S? I don't think this program represents some fantastic innovation of Ferber or whatever run-of-the-mill sleep programs, if anything its almost more confusing and wordy than needed.\n\nThe ABC videos are non-sensical!! The letter \"L\" is dedicated to copyright piracy for god's sakes! I'm kind of peeved that this \"90+ minute\" video series has like 5 minutes dedicated to lecturing you about illegally sharing the program!\n\n**The hype is overblown**\n\nLook, just don't spend your hard earned money on this thing unless you've tried cheaper resources and other methods first. If you've tried and read it all, and TCB is your last hurrah at sleep training sanity - its worth it. Or, if you like Cara, you want to support her, you like videos - go ahead. Again, no judgement!\n\nBut the fact that TCB is increasingly treated as the *default* approach on Reddit is totally disproportional to the quality and value of the program. It might seem like the secret, exclusive, hidden knowledge of sleep training, but its not. That's really what I wanted to say.\n\nFin",

        "selftext": "You might have seen my comments around this subreddit (a lot) and a few of you have encouraged me to make a mega post. (Ta-da! here it is!)  Just quickly on why I have collected this copy-paste resource: I was really frustrated with how reddit works- lots of people posting the same question, with the upvote/downvote no one sees the same version of reddit, so it was hard for people to learn from other threads.  I felt like I was typing out the same answers all the time, so I gathered them together and would copy/paste as needed. (so yes, please share, please steal!) I also was frustrated that there wasn't a good resource on gentle sleep methods.  \n\nThis is a baby sleep guide, (not a sleep training guide) because even if you don't train, there's so much to learn about baby sleep that can help.  This is what drew me to this sub initially- because who knows about sleep? People who sleep train. \n\nSleep training gets presented as this black and white \"cosleep until they are seven, or leave baby to cry alone until their heart breaks\" (neither an accurate representation!) and there's no middle ground presented.  The middle ground exists!  It's big! There are lots of sleep training methods that work, especially if you put in the work to set baby up for success. \n\n##General Principles\nBefore diving in, a common thing is that parents feel that they've \"missed the boat\" if they haven't started with a newborn, 4 month old, or whatever. It's never to late to get better sleep, you can jump in wherever you're at. **You don't have to have followed the newborn bit to succeed at the later bits**, and so on.  Guide is organised chronologically by age, but skip up to where you're at. \n\n**All babies are individuals!** The advice might not apply to your baby. Your baby might hit milestones at slightly different times.  That said, the general patterns and principles are there because they seem to hold true for a lot of children, so if your child is way off what's 'normal' it might be time to look into that. You know your child best, though.\n\n**Be aware of the process:** while nightweaning might be the ultimate goal, independent sleep and a good schedule are the steps before that, it doesn't work so well to jump straight to night weaning. \n\n**Talk to your child** about what's going on. Yes, they might not understand yet, but that's how immersion works. Eventually, they will! \n\n**I'm no expert**. I only have a sample size of one (new baby joining us in 2022, we'll see how we go!) plus learning lots of stuff about sleep through this sub, getting feedback on whether my advice worked.  *Precious Little Sleep* by Alexis Dubief is an amazing resource.  I lean heavily on her website! *(Parenting pro-tip- buy the ebook, you can read it on your phone when holding that baby!)* \n\n##Newborns\nNawww. Welcome to the world, little one. \n\nHere's a comment I made about newborns https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/k439pn/anyone_willing_to_share_a_newborn_guide/ge7imn1/\n\nHere's Precious Little Sleep's newborn guide https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/newborn-baby-sleep-survival-guide/   \n        \n##The big comment: a guide to sleep training (gentle focus)\n(this is basically what I've been spamming this sub with for the last year. :) )   \n\n---\nThe first thing to set up to give yourself the best chance of sleep training success is to establish a schedule or rhythm with [age appropriate wake windows- (scroll down for the chart, can skip the article if you like)](https://www.slumberpod.com/blogs/our-blog/age-appropriate-awake-windows) so  baby isn't over or under tired at bed time.  (For naps, [this guide to short naps](https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/monumental-guide-to-short-naps/) really helped us. ) \n\nAnother thing to make sure is that you have a calm and consistent bed time routine where your last feed is ending half an hour before bed time, and ends with baby in bed by themselves with the same conditions for the night. (Baby needs to be biologically ready- really little babies just fall asleep when eating- it's natural.) \n\n[This article at Precious Little Sleep](https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-sleeping-through-the-night-part-i) explains what's going on with baby sleep. It is a good summary and worth reading!  \n\nAll sleep training will involve a little fussing, this article helps explain what that looks like: [Fussing vs Crying](https://misunderstoodmotherhood.substack.com/p/what-the-heck-is-fussing) \n\nThere are a lot of sleep training methods. Here are some gentle ones, others are Ferber and CIO.  I feel it's important to understand the theory of what you're trying to achieve (independent sleep) and find a mix of methods that work for your family. \n \n**Gentle Sleep training methods:**\n \n1. [Give baby a chance method](https://misunderstoodmotherhood.substack.com/p/give-baby-a-chance)\n \n2. [Sleep lady shuffle](https://sleeplady.com/baby-sleep-problems/the-gentle-sleep-coaching-process/)\n \n3. Pick up put down, camp it out and chair method are others.\n \nI really recommend Precious Little Sleep, the ebook is really reasonably priced. There are a range of options explored.\n \n**What we did**\n \n[DIY Gentle Method](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/nahpbg/progress_report_diy_gentle_method/) - a mix of methods that worked for us.   \n\n[This is what we did for feed to sleep](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/kaqr7f/car_inspired_gentleish_method) - we chose to do that before sleep training, some families move right to sleep training. My husband has said that he wouldn't do this again, but I think it worked ok, but not as a sleep training method. \n\n---\n\n##A potential issue with gentle methods\nSo the goal of sleep training is independent sleep- baby needs to fall asleep alone in order to know it's OK to fall asleep alone, so when they microwake at the end of a sleep cycle, they slip into the next one instead of waking up and going \"hey!! where's my sleep help?!\"  Methods like pick up put down and the chair method don't remove the parent until the end of the process, so you've got to be consistent for a LONG time and might not see results until you remove yourself.  You don't have to leave baby a long time, but they need a chance to fall asleep alone. \n\n##Tips by age- I guess a bit of a FAQ.\n\n**2-4 months ish**  \nThis is when things get HARD.  Lovely newborn conk out all the time, sleep anywhere is GONE.  Baby is starting to really wake up and notice the world. If the first three months are the fourth trimester, this is like labour. \n\nA lot of parents post asking if it's too early to sleep train.  And yes, if we're talking traditional cry it out methods, it's too early to sleep train.  However, you can start gently practicing independent sleep, knowing that you may need to step in and help baby sleep if it's been too long (max 20 minutes.)  \n\nUndertired is a sneaky enemy- for a long time overtired has been your main enemy, and suddenly UNDERTIRED sneaks in and looks exactly like over tired.  Finding the balance between them can be tricky! But around now is the time to ask \"maybe baby needs to stay awake just a smidge longer\". \n\nWith little babies, sometimes you go to put baby to bed early, they aren't tired, but they aren't being stimulated, so the nap doesn't work.  If it's been 30 minutes of trying for a nap, give up, go do something else for half and hour, and try again. \n\nhttps://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-we-learned-from-the-rock-n-play-recall/ - A really interesting blog post about why it's no longer reccommended to do sleep in swings, and why it's important to encourage independent sleep as soon as possible, before parents curl up from exhaustion. \n\nIf your baby doesn't like swaddling, don't worry. It's harder to get rid of later.  If your baby hates being unswaddled, stick with it. They do get used to it eventually.  \n\n**4 months**  \n* It's normal for naps to be crappy. It's normal to have a lot! We had 5 regularly at one point. \n* If you don't train, the 'regression' (major sleep development) will get better as their sleep cycles lengthen, but independent sleep solves a lot. \n* It is normal to be waking at night to feed, still. \n* Yes, the regression is the sign that baby may be ready to sleep train.  You don't have to wait until it ends- it won't. \n* If you haven't ditched the swaddle, do so. \n\n**5 months (aka dropping to 3 naps?)**    \nSomewhere in the 4-6 months range, the development for consolidating naps happens.  Baby is changing a LOT in a short amount of time, so you thought you'd figured out the wake windows that work? They probably need stretching.  Some people really push dropping to three naps already, but make sure baby is getting enough day sleep before you do.  We were on four naps at 5 months and had dropped to 3 at the end of the month.  It's OK to hold on to a nap if baby needs it. \n\nIt's also still really normal to be feeding a few times overnight still. \n\n**6 - 7 months (aka dropping to 2 naps?)** \nSix months is tricky because baby is starting to grow out of the three nap schedule, but probably isn't quite ready to drop to two naps.  From now on, the secret to dropping naps is: \"can baby stay awake long enough?\". \n\nMy advice is to lock in bed time to a fixed actual clock time, like 7pm, 7:30pm, 8pm, or whatever suits your family.  (Think about your desired wake time too- some babies do 12 hour nights, some 11, and some, 10.)   This way you can take advantage of the circadian rhythm. \n\nAs you gently stretch wake windows and hopefully naps get longer, nap three will get squeezed until it's too short to keep, and you'll drop to two naps. \n\nHere's our nap dropping experience. https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ll6gja/dropped_a_nap/   \n\n\n**8-10 months**  \nSeparation anxiety might be a thing, developments might make things interesting.  Things like sitting in the bed, standing in the bed and not being able to lie down, etc. It's OK to leave baby to figure it out.  Lots of daytime practice helps, but ultimately they've got to apply those skills. \n\nWe really enjoyed being on a clock based schedule (based on 3/3/4) instead of rigidly following wake windows. \n\n**11-16 months (aka dropping to one nap??)** \nLike dropping to 2 naps, the criteria is: can baby stay awake long enough?  There can be a 'false sign' that baby is ready to drop to one nap around the 10-13 month stage- often this is because of the explosion of development (words, walking) that might be happening about now.  You might need to cap naps and max out a two nap schedule.  We found that once running was a thing, baby was getting physically tired and went back to taking full advantage of two 90 minute naps during the day. \n\nWe found the 12 month regression real, it kicked our butts.  But at 12 months we added two small, safe, soft toys for night sleep (sometimes called 'loveys') and this made a big difference for sleep. \n\nDropping to one nap was one of the harder transitions we've done. (We moved to one nap at 15 months.  Like walking, the range of when babies are developmentally ready to drop is very big! Some babies keep two naps until 18 months, some drop around 12.)  Suddenly we were back to wake windows and trying to stretch them 10 minutes at a time. If we stretched too far the nap would be too short and the day would be hard.  We were stuck on 11:20am naps for a while. (11:30? No way!)  Figuring out when to feed her was tricky.  But it was worth the pain and we are now back on a one nap clock based schedule.  (Up at 7, nap 12-2, bedtime 8pm) \n\n##Older kiddos\n\n[How to use a toddler alarm clock (PLS)](https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/how-to-use-a-toddler-alarm-clock)\n\nFor older kids, there are four methods that I know of.\n\n1) chair method- also called sleep lady shuffle. Basically you gradually move a chair out of the room by moving it a little each night.\n\n2) excuses method. This is like reverse Ferber. Instead of check ins, check out. Do your routine with snuggles etc, but leave with an excuse like \"I have to go to the toilet, I'll be right back\" etc. Teaching kiddo that you do keep your promise, you will be back, and they are ok to be alone and hopefully fall asleep. Longer and longer \"check outs\" after a fairly short initial one.\n\n3) [Super Nanny method](https://www.supernanny.co.uk/Advice/-/Parenting-Skills/-/Routine-and-Teamwork/Getting-Toddlers-to-Stay-in-Bed.aspx). There's a process, but basically you just end up plopping kid back into bed until they give up and stay in bed.\n\n4) baby gate the room, kid proof, they may fall asleep on the floor, that's cool. Then do CIO or other more standard younger kid method.  (This is for kids who aren't in a cot/crib anymore. \n\n##Other topics  \n**Wake window notation**   \nOften used as a shorthand in this sub, something like 3/3/4 means that baby has a two nap schedule (/ is a nap) with wake windows of three hours, three hours, and four hours. \n\n**The over tired spiral**  \nWhen baby gets overtired, so they don't sleep, so they get overtired, so they don't sleep- this is miserable.  We found you need to FIGHT baby to sleep however you can (rocking, etc) to reset. \n\n**Distraction Technique**  \nBabies get FOMO. (Fear Of Missing Out).  Then they develop the ability to recognise A, then B, means that C is coming up next. (C is sleep! We don't want sleep!)  We found that after getting baby ready for bed we would go and do something else for a few minutes (talking to the 'mirror baby' or going outside if really upset) before continuing the routine when baby was calm. \n\n**Naps**   \nNaps are mentioned all through the guide, but a quick naps guide\nhttps://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/monumental-guide-to-short-naps/ \n\nIt's really normal for naps to be short and painful (to get) until the development for consolidated naps kicks in around 4-6 months. \n\nI suggest doing nights first, then naps, not all at once.  For training naps, do one at a time, not all at once.  Try leaving baby for 10-15 minutes and then rescue the nap if needed,  the overall rhythm of the day is important to overnight sleep. \n\nIf baby is happy in their cot, it's OK to leave them until you want to get them up! \n\n**Night weaning**   \nSo worth it- our baby is finally sleeping through.  For us, there was a lot of talking about how the milkies were getting smaller (I was capping feeds and cutting down minutes per side- the pace that worked for us was about 1 minute a week- too fast and she'd wake up more often.)  Then we talked about how the milkies are available when the sun is shining, that the milkies are sleeping at night time now and we can have them in the morning. \n\nFor initial training, not feeding before midnight was a really helpful guideline- if we fed before midnight we were in for a bad night. \n\nhttps://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-sleeping-through-the-night-part-3 - PLS night weaning guide \n\nhttps://www.drjaygordon.com/blog-detail/sleep-changing-patterns-in-the-family-bed - we also found this article helpful- even though it's from the perspective of a bed sharing advocate, it has a gentle nightweaning approach that I borrowed from. \n\nIf your baby is older than 6 months, talk to your doctor if night weaning is appropriate.  Some babies still feed overnight until 12 months. (Or longer, but once past 12 months I think parent can choose to night wean.) \n\n**Other things we've found useful** \n\nWater before bed!  Sometimes kids are just thirsty.  It's ok to offer a sip of water (we do it after brushing teeth) and it helps with sleeping through. \n\nBefore bed time snack- we found we need to time this so it doesn't result in a feed to sleep association, but we offer porridge, banana and yogurt before bed. Apparently the banana can help with muscle aches.",

(Baby needs to be biologically ready- really little babies just fall asleep when eating- it&#39;s natural.) </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-sleeping-through-the-night-part-i\">This article at Precious Little Sleep</a> explains what&#39;s going on with baby sleep. It is a good summary and worth reading!  </p>\n\n<p>All sleep training will involve a little fussing, this article helps explain what that looks like: <a href=\"https://misunderstoodmotherhood.substack.com/p/what-the-heck-is-fussing\">Fussing vs Crying</a> </p>\n\n<p>There are a lot of sleep training methods. Here are some gentle ones, others are Ferber and CIO.  I feel it&#39;s important to understand the theory of what you&#39;re trying to achieve (independent sleep) and find a mix of methods that work for your family. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Gentle Sleep training methods:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://misunderstoodmotherhood.substack.com/p/give-baby-a-chance\">Give baby a chance method</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://sleeplady.com/baby-sleep-problems/the-gentle-sleep-coaching-process/\">Sleep lady shuffle</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Pick up put down, camp it out and chair method are others.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I really recommend Precious Little Sleep, the ebook is really reasonably priced. There are a range of options explored.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What we did</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/nahpbg/progress_report_diy_gentle_method/\">DIY Gentle Method</a> - a mix of methods that worked for us.   </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/kaqr7f/car_inspired_gentleish_method\">This is what we did for feed to sleep</a> - we chose to do that before sleep training, some families move right to sleep training. My husband has said that he wouldn&#39;t do this again, but I think it worked ok, but not as a sleep training method. </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h2>A potential issue with gentle methods</h2>\n\n<p>So the goal of sleep training is independent sleep- baby needs to fall asleep alone in order to know it&#39;s OK to fall asleep alone, so when they microwake at the end of a sleep cycle, they slip into the next one instead of waking up and going &quot;hey!! where&#39;s my sleep help?!&quot;  Methods like pick up put down and the chair method don&#39;t remove the parent until the end of the process, so you&#39;ve got to be consistent for a LONG time and might not see results until you remove yourself.  You don&#39;t have to leave baby a long time, but they need a chance to fall asleep alone. </p>\n\n<h2>Tips by age- I guess a bit of a FAQ.</h2>\n\n<p><strong>2-4 months ish</strong><br/>\nThis is when things get HARD.  Lovely newborn conk out all the time, sleep anywhere is GONE.  Baby is starting to really wake up and notice the world. If the first three months are the fourth trimester, this is like labour. </p>\n\n<p>A lot of parents post asking if it&#39;s too early to sleep train.  And yes, if we&#39;re talking traditional cry it out methods, it&#39;s too early to sleep train.  However, you can start gently practicing independent sleep, knowing that you may need to step in and help baby sleep if it&#39;s been too long (max 20 minutes.)  </p>\n\n<p>Undertired is a sneaky enemy- for a long time overtired has been your main enemy, and suddenly UNDERTIRED sneaks in and looks exactly like over tired.  Finding the balance between them can be tricky! But around now is the time to ask &quot;maybe baby needs to stay awake just a smidge longer&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>With little babies, sometimes you go to put baby to bed early, they aren&#39;t tired, but they aren&#39;t being stimulated, so the nap doesn&#39;t work.  If it&#39;s been 30 minutes of trying for a nap, give up, go do something else for half and hour, and try again. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-we-learned-from-the-rock-n-play-recall/\">https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-we-learned-from-the-rock-n-play-recall/</a> - A really interesting blog post about why it&#39;s no longer reccommended to do sleep in swings, and why it&#39;s important to encourage independent sleep as soon as possible, before parents curl up from exhaustion. </p>\n\n<p>If your baby doesn&#39;t like swaddling, don&#39;t worry. It&#39;s harder to get rid of later.  If your baby hates being unswaddled, stick with it. They do get used to it eventually.  </p>\n\n<p><strong>4 months</strong><br/>\n* It&#39;s normal for naps to be crappy. It&#39;s normal to have a lot! We had 5 regularly at one point. \n* If you don&#39;t train, the &#39;regression&#39; (major sleep development) will get better as their sleep cycles lengthen, but independent sleep solves a lot. \n* It is normal to be waking at night to feed, still. \n* Yes, the regression is the sign that baby may be ready to sleep train.  You don&#39;t have to wait until it ends- it won&#39;t. \n* If you haven&#39;t ditched the swaddle, do so. </p>\n\n<p><strong>5 months (aka dropping to 3 naps?)</strong><br/>\nSomewhere in the 4-6 months range, the development for consolidating naps happens.  Baby is changing a LOT in a short amount of time, so you thought you&#39;d figured out the wake windows that work? They probably need stretching.  Some people really push dropping to three naps already, but make sure baby is getting enough day sleep before you do.  We were on four naps at 5 months and had dropped to 3 at the end of the month.  It&#39;s OK to hold on to a nap if baby needs it. </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s also still really normal to be feeding a few times overnight still. </p>\n\n<p><strong>6 - 7 months (aka dropping to 2 naps?)</strong> \nSix months is tricky because baby is starting to grow out of the three nap schedule, but probably isn&#39;t quite ready to drop to two naps.  From now on, the secret to dropping naps is: &quot;can baby stay awake long enough?&quot;. </p>\n\n<p>My advice is to lock in bed time to a fixed actual clock time, like 7pm, 7:30pm, 8pm, or whatever suits your family.  (Think about your desired wake time too- some babies do 12 hour nights, some 11, and some, 10.)   This way you can take advantage of the circadian rhythm. </p>\n\n<p>As you gently stretch wake windows and hopefully naps get longer, nap three will get squeezed until it&#39;s too short to keep, and you&#39;ll drop to two naps. </p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s our nap dropping experience. <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ll6gja/dropped_a_nap/\">https://www.reddit.com/r/sleeptrain/comments/ll6gja/dropped_a_nap/</a>   </p>\n\n<p><strong>8-10 months</strong><br/>\nSeparation anxiety might be a thing, developments might make things interesting.  Things like sitting in the bed, standing in the bed and not being able to lie down, etc. It&#39;s OK to leave baby to figure it out.  Lots of daytime practice helps, but ultimately they&#39;ve got to apply those skills. </p>\n\n<p>We really enjoyed being on a clock based schedule (based on 3/3/4) instead of rigidly following wake windows. </p>\n\n<p><strong>11-16 months (aka dropping to one nap??)</strong> \nLike dropping to 2 naps, the criteria is: can baby stay awake long enough?  There can be a &#39;false sign&#39; that baby is ready to drop to one nap around the 10-13 month stage- often this is because of the explosion of development (words, walking) that might be happening about now.  You might need to cap naps and max out a two nap schedule.  We found that once running was a thing, baby was getting physically tired and went back to taking full advantage of two 90 minute naps during the day. </p>\n\n<p>We found the 12 month regression real, it kicked our butts.  But at 12 months we added two small, safe, soft toys for night sleep (sometimes called &#39;loveys&#39;) and this made a big difference for sleep. </p>\n\n<p>Dropping to one nap was one of the harder transitions we&#39;ve done. (We moved to one nap at 15 months.  Like walking, the range of when babies are developmentally ready to drop is very big! Some babies keep two naps until 18 months, some drop around 12.)  Suddenly we were back to wake windows and trying to stretch them 10 minutes at a time. If we stretched too far the nap would be too short and the day would be hard.  We were stuck on 11:20am naps for a while. (11:30? No way!)  Figuring out when to feed her was tricky.  But it was worth the pain and we are now back on a one nap clock based schedule.  (Up at 7, nap 12-2, bedtime 8pm) </p>\n\n<h2>Older kiddos</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/how-to-use-a-toddler-alarm-clock\">How to use a toddler alarm clock (PLS)</a></p>\n\n<p>For older kids, there are four methods that I know of.</p>\n\n<p>1) chair method- also called sleep lady shuffle. Basically you gradually move a chair out of the room by moving it a little each night.</p>\n\n<p>2) excuses method. This is like reverse Ferber. Instead of check ins, check out. Do your routine with snuggles etc, but leave with an excuse like &quot;I have to go to the toilet, I&#39;ll be right back&quot; etc. Teaching kiddo that you do keep your promise, you will be back, and they are ok to be alone and hopefully fall asleep. Longer and longer &quot;check outs&quot; after a fairly short initial one.</p>\n\n<p>3) <a href=\"https://www.supernanny.co.uk/Advice/-/Parenting-Skills/-/Routine-and-Teamwork/Getting-Toddlers-to-Stay-in-Bed.aspx\">Super Nanny method</a>. There&#39;s a process, but basically you just end up plopping kid back into bed until they give up and stay in bed.</p>\n\n<p>4) baby gate the room, kid proof, they may fall asleep on the floor, that&#39;s cool. Then do CIO or other more standard younger kid method.  (This is for kids who aren&#39;t in a cot/crib anymore. </p>\n\n<h2>Other topics</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Wake window notation</strong><br/>\nOften used as a shorthand in this sub, something like 3/3/4 means that baby has a two nap schedule (/ is a nap) with wake windows of three hours, three hours, and four hours. </p>\n\n<p><strong>The over tired spiral</strong><br/>\nWhen baby gets overtired, so they don&#39;t sleep, so they get overtired, so they don&#39;t sleep- this is miserable.  We found you need to FIGHT baby to sleep however you can (rocking, etc) to reset. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Distraction Technique</strong><br/>\nBabies get FOMO. (Fear Of Missing Out).  Then they develop the ability to recognise A, then B, means that C is coming up next. (C is sleep! We don&#39;t want sleep!)  We found that after getting baby ready for bed we would go and do something else for a few minutes (talking to the &#39;mirror baby&#39; or going outside if really upset) before continuing the routine when baby was calm. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Naps</strong><br/>\nNaps are mentioned all through the guide, but a quick naps guide\n<a href=\"https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/monumental-guide-to-short-naps/\">https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/monumental-guide-to-short-naps/</a> </p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s really normal for naps to be short and painful (to get) until the development for consolidated naps kicks in around 4-6 months. </p>\n\n<p>I suggest doing nights first, then naps, not all at once.  For training naps, do one at a time, not all at once.  Try leaving baby for 10-15 minutes and then rescue the nap if needed,  the overall rhythm of the day is important to overnight sleep. </p>\n\n<p>If baby is happy in their cot, it&#39;s OK to leave them until you want to get them up! </p>\n\n<p><strong>Night weaning</strong><br/>\nSo worth it- our baby is finally sleeping through.  For us, there was a lot of talking about how the milkies were getting smaller (I was capping feeds and cutting down minutes per side- the pace that worked for us was about 1 minute a week- too fast and she&#39;d wake up more often.)  Then we talked about how the milkies are available when the sun is shining, that the milkies are sleeping at night time now and we can have them in the morning. </p>\n\n<p>For initial training, not feeding before midnight was a really helpful guideline- if we fed before midnight we were in for a bad night. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-sleeping-through-the-night-part-3\">https://www.preciouslittlesleep.com/what-you-need-to-know-about-sleeping-through-the-night-part-3</a> - PLS night weaning guide </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drjaygordon.com/blog-detail/sleep-changing-patterns-in-the-family-bed\">https://www.drjaygordon.com/blog-detail/sleep-changing-patterns-in-the-family-bed</a> - we also found this article helpful- even though it&#39;s from the perspective of a bed sharing advocate, it has a gentle nightweaning approach that I borrowed from. </p>\n\n<p>If your baby is older than 6 months, talk to your doctor if night weaning is appropriate.  Some babies still feed overnight until 12 months. (Or longer, but once past 12 months I think parent can choose to night wean.) </p>\n\n<p><strong>Other things we&#39;ve found useful</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Water before bed!  Sometimes kids are just thirsty.  It&#39;s ok to offer a sip of water (we do it after brushing teeth) and it helps with sleeping through. </p>\n\n<p>Before bed time snack- we found we need to time this so it doesn&#39;t result in a feed to sleep association, but we offer porridge, banana and yogurt before bed. Apparently the banana can help with muscle aches.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

        "selftext": "After 54 hours of labor, Ivy was born at home on my living room floor on Nov 22 2019. Sleeping was impossible. I hated to hear her cry, my body instinctively responded to her and I couldn\u2019t imagine stopping it. My mother-in-law warned me not to \u201clet her use my boob as a pacifier\u201d, but I always let her nurse as much as she wanted and it seemed to be her go to comfort as she never took a rubber pacifier or a bottle. When she was tiny, I would swaddle her, nurse her to sleep, and then in super slow motion put her down in the bassinet. 70% of the time she would wake up and I would have to start all over again. It would regularly take me 45 min to and hour or more to get her down, for every nap and every time she woke up throughout the night.\n\nAs she got bigger and was rolling as we had to stop swaddling, I started using the Snuggle Me pillow to put her down without waking her up. I would nurse her while she was lying in the pillow on my lap, then after she dozed I would unlatch her and pick the pillow up with her on it and slow motion transfer to crib. She would usually wake 20 min later and I would have to start again. I got no time alone with my husband, I started to resent him as he got to sit downstairs and watch TV as I killed myself to get our girl to sleep.\n\nAround 6 months she got too big for the pillow. I could not put her down without waking her up. I actually started nursing and rocking her to sleep, then climbing into the crib with her still on my boob and lying down with her in her crib until she reached a deep sleep at which time I would unlatch her and do some silent slow motion ninja moves to get out of the crib without waking her. I would do this 3,4 sometimes 6 times between bedtime (7ish) and when my husband and I would go to sleep around midnight. Then the next time she woke up I would just give up and take her in bed with me. \n\nThen she started rolling over and crawling and pulling herself up on the crib. I was at a loss. I would spend hours every day and night rocking her, fighting her as she\u2019s simultaneously breastfeeding and kicking me away with both feet. One night I punched the crib in frustration when she awoke as I was climbing out. \n\nWe had to make a change. We decided we were going to try cry it out with my husband in the room, not me. I did the bedtime routine, bath, stories, songs and nursing, then put her in her crib awake and said night night mommy loves you go to sleep. She started crying immediately.\n\nThen my husband went in. I hate to admit I had no confidence in his ability to soothe her. At first he just sat in the chair next to the crib and told her it\u2019s going to be ok. She cried for about 20 minutes that first night. When her crying got bad, he picked her up but he also couldn\u2019t put her down without waking her. So he started just rubbing her back and laying her down when she stood up, saying positive things like I believe in you baby, it\u2019s ok, you can do this your doing great.\n\n2 days later and it takes him 5 minutes to put her to bed, when she awakens at night and for naps. She protests minimally at first, more grumbles than real cries though. Tonight he put her in her crib and she laid right down and put herself to sleep. I watched on the monitor totally dumbfounded.\n\nMy recommendation to all you weary moms who feel like your the only one who can get your babe to sleep - is maybe, if you have someone to help, try removing yourself from the equation. Try it first at night when she is really tired. The first night is tough. Hearing her cry when I knew I had what she thought she needed (boobies) was hell. But it\u2019s worth it. I was the mom who said I would never sleep train. And now I say screw all the heated opinions around those words \u201csleep training.\u201d If where your at isn\u2019t working, make a change.

        "selftext": "It's 2 AM and I hear you stir. Will you go back to sleep like you often do? Or will this be one of the nights you need a little bit of help?\n\nThe crying starts and we start the timer. 1 minute seems like an hour - 10 minutes an eternity. Fleeting moments of anger flit through my mind, but then I wonder - what is going through your mind as you raise your little head up towards us. Are you sleepy? Or is the \"mamamam\" sound you make while crying a plea for me to come to your side? How can I be angry when you are crying out for help? I try to tune you out - climbing Everest would be easier.\n\nThe timer goes off and I spring out of bed to pick you up. You put your little arms around my neck, your breathing slows down, and your body turns to lead. You let out a little sigh and fall asleep in my arms with your head on my shoulder. I'm tired, you are tired.  . I place my hand on your back and feel the rhythm of you breathing. You needed me and so I'm here. I'll keep you safe and give you comfort. I don't want to ever let go. Time stands still and in this moment, it is just you and I. \n\nWe make it through the night. You seem no worse for wear while we feel like road kill.

I tend to think what is considered a \u201cgentle\u201d method is very baby-specific.  \n\nFor example, my son, at around 5 months just had ZERO ability to put himself to sleep. We used a bassinet that automatically rocked for the first few months and when he grew out of that bassinet we would get him to sleep by walking him around on our chest.  He 100% relied on us to fall asleep so if he woke up in the middle of the night, which all babies do (adults do as well) then he just was completely incapable of getting himself back to sleep.  I felt awful, he would wake up panicked and screaming and needed our comfort to get back down sleep.  He wasn\u2019t well rested during the day and I think he was stressed out.  I then tried several methods of sleep training because I thought I wasn\u2019t the \u201ctype\u201d of parent who could do CIO.  Turns out, those methods made his anxiety much worse and us interfering with him learning to self soothe was just prolonging the agony.   He started to cling to us more and was frightened.  In fact, some of the more \u201cgentler methods\u201d actually caused my baby to vomit in his crib and have horrible anxiety.  \n\nFinally we tried CIO.  Guess what, he cried the first few nights but still cried much less collectively in one night  than when he was unable to self soothe and was totally dependent on us to fall asleep.  Now, we have a baby (16 months now) who goes into the crib fully awake, cuddles up, and goes to sleep on his own.  Some nights he wakes up, sits up, looks around and then goes back to sleep.  He no longer has panic attacks and is all shook up with terror. He loves his crib and is excited to cuddle up when he\u2019s tired and go to sleep. \n\nBy having the courage to do CIO, we gave our baby the tools to fall asleep and back asleep on his own.  He needed that.  Every baby is different.  Listen to your child and do what is best for them.  Forget the stigmas.
