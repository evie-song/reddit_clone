Landlord checked everything thoroughly and is still in talks with us to help us with this issue. \n\n2) We got a new meter, which read accurately when we checked it everyday. \n\n3) The city\u2019s online portal showed that our water usage skyrocketed MORE even after the new meter. Apparently the meter is supposed to transmit data to the portal for us to track, and they \u201cnever overestimate\u201d. I\u2019m talking like 35,000 gals one day, 15,000 the next, 20,000 after that, then like 3 days of nothing, then 1,500 gals at 4 am. Then it just all stopped and went to normal usage. Plus all the \u201chigh usage\u201d started like a month ago according to the portal; something seemed to change overnight for some reason, we\u2019re not really sure, as we\u2019ve checked everything for leaks. I brought this up with the city and the lady acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Said she saw one day of 7,000 gals, but nothing about 15,000+ gals even though I literally was looking at the data. \n\n4) According to the same lady, apparently we live in a \u201cmulti family household\u201d and so owe like $150 more on our water utility deposit. The next city worker we talked to was confused about what the hell she was talking about. So that\u2019s still in the air.\n\n5) Landlord was mad at city (this happens a lot I guess) and sent people to talk with them, and after A LOT of back and forth with the city, they finally admitted their online portal was wrong and they\u2019re trying to fix it so it doesn\u2019t overestimate our costs. We\u2019re also apparently infamous at their headquarters because we\u2019ve called a million times to get this sorted out. So that\u2019s fun I guess? \n\n6) Sadly might be stuck with 49,000 gal water bill, as over the phone during our first call we mentioned the toilet issue, but later it\u2019s been clarified by our landlord/the repairman it wasn\u2019t an issue? Idrk, I wasn\u2019t there to listen in with that. Still sorting that out to see if it really was the root cause. \n\n7) Going forward our next water bills will be normal and the city has apologized for all the chaos. \n\nKinda resolved, kinda not. At this point I don\u2019t even know if the toilet was the issue or not, as everyone is saying different things trying to not have to pay the bill if it was the issue. I personally haven\u2019t been home during all the talks about the toilet with repairmen/the landlord, so I don\u2019t really know; just know the city isn\u2019t budging so far on the past period\u2019s high bill. If we have to pay, so be it, im just tired of being on hold over the phone just for someone to ask if we have a swimming pool, garden, sprinklers, etc. which we don\u2019t.\n\n\nEdit for clarification:\n\nThere\u2019s no leaks of 35k gals, it\u2019s just their online portal is messed up. No one\u2019s stealing water, we don\u2019t have anything running all day, and we don\u2019t have any grass to water or anything; just concrete and dirt backyard. There\u2019s a lot of nuances with the toilet thing. Even though the toilet is now fixed and isn\u2019t the issue, it MAY have been the original issue for the 49k gals \u2014 again, we don\u2019t really know because it is fixed now and we don\u2019t have any of the old data. Landlord and the repairman said it was not bad enough to leak 49k gals at all, which we agree with, but they won\u2019t help cover water bill. City knows we had a toilet issue and is dead set right now that it used 49k gals over 3 weeks. We\u2019re still trying to figure all that out. So there\u2019s a chance the 49k is from the toilet and our landlord just doesn\u2019t want to help figure that out/help maybe cover some of the bill, and there\u2019s also a chance that the old meter was broken and overcounting/their online system was messed up; who knows at this point. The 49k gal water bill is due soon, and right now we might just pay because we\u2019re hitting a brick wall getting that bill lower. At least future bills will be normal.",

Idk maybe I'm just being overly sensitive considering how much Reckful helped me with his content, and how many times I have had to see this shitty cycle of people just latching onto reasons to harass him over a mistake again and again, and now that cycle ended in the worst way possible. But we need to be better, what is the point of everyone saying how shitty harassment is, or say bullying is bad after the fact, if we never actually implement change. People who use this sub, and Mods, need to make an explicit commitment to not enable shit type of beahviour, to call it out, and actually try to fix the shitty toxic cesspool this reddit has become. We can't be part of the problem, especially one that leads to the type of consequences that happened today.\n\nEdit:\n\nFirst, some of you seem to misunderstand and think this thread is saying bullying is the only/main issue, it is not. Mental Health and Illness is complex and is impacted by many different things. The point of this thread was to not be one of those negative impacts, and be better.  Just because other issues exist, doesn't mean we should help create and fuel the bullying/harassment issue.\n\nSecond, Ideally what I would like from this post if it keeps getting the attention it has been, is an actual response and commitment from Mods to stop, or at least try to stop, days where 100 different threads are made to shit on a single person.",

Rule No 1 is literally don&#39;t be a dick, yet you&#39;ll have days where the entire front page is just old clips of whoever LSF decided to hate that day.</p>\n\n<p>This is what we this sub adds to often:  <a href=\"https://clips.twitch.tv/ToughObliqueCasettePogChamp\">https://clips.twitch.tv/ToughObliqueCasettePogChamp</a></p>\n\n<p>Mods need to start actually being more proactive, why do we need 100 different threads of old clips to shit on a person, if they make a mistake one thread is enough (ideally without being filled with harassment). Idk maybe I&#39;m just being overly sensitive considering how much Reckful helped me with his content, and how many times I have had to see this shitty cycle of people just latching onto reasons to harass him over a mistake again and again, and now that cycle ended in the worst way possible. But we need to be better, what is the point of everyone saying how shitty harassment is, or say bullying is bad after the fact, if we never actually implement change. People who use this sub, and Mods, need to make an explicit commitment to not enable shit type of beahviour, to call it out, and actually try to fix the shitty toxic cesspool this reddit has become. We can&#39;t be part of the problem, especially one that leads to the type of consequences that happened today.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:</p>\n\n<p>First, some of you seem to misunderstand and think this thread is saying bullying is the only/main issue, it is not. Mental Health and Illness is complex and is impacted by many different things. The point of this thread was to not be one of those negative impacts, and be better.  Just because other issues exist, doesn&#39;t mean we should help create and fuel the bullying/harassment issue.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Ideally what I would like from this post if it keeps getting the attention it has been, is an actual response and commitment from Mods to stop, or at least try to stop, days where 100 different threads are made to shit on a single person.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t go out for drinks with your co-workers once in a while. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you don\u2019t try to be involved in your child\u2019s life, no matter how much support you pay. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t help out your brother with babysitting once in a while, even if you\u2019re childfree. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you wear nothing but underwear in your own home when your roommate has guests over. They\u2019ll think you\u2019re an asshole if you can\u2019t detour for 10 minutes a day to carpool with a co-worker for a week while his car is in the shop.\n\nThe internet has its own values, and that\u2019s fine.

My [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/awyi8k/aita_for_despising_my_mentally_handicap_sister/) got a lot of attention and seeing as you guys seem interested, here's my update.\n\nWell, since that day I made the post i've been staying with my grandfather. The week's been honestly a huge change for me for better and for worse but i'll try to run it down.\n\nI started by telling my grandpa the story of why I broke down the way I did and to be honest, he seemed horrified. No one in my family knew my parents were using me as essentially a free care service for my sister. My grandpa told me some things that I don't feel comfortable repeating here but in essence my sister is \"supposed\" to be getting care from a professional and that my parents were ignoring that, along with this I was not supposed to be caring for her at all with her mental state as apparently she is a danger to herself and others. With everything else I told him, along with stuff like the movie indecent he was really mad and told me to not contact my parents without him there. He pretty much told me that he would be meeting with my parents beforehand and that he was going to be there when I sat down with them. It didn't end here either, the rest of the week consisted of other family checking in on me and telling me things my parents hid from me. This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a \"caretaker\" that doesn't exist.\n\nSuffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i've felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week \"making up for the time i've lost.\" Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.\n\nWell, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying \"You were put here to be her caretaker\". I won't lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.\n\nToday will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I'm not going back. Later today i'm going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i'm planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.\n\nI won't be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i've learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don't hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.\n\nSo, there's my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I'll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLate edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it's kinda cliche and i've said it a thousand times but thank you all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it's at my grandpa's house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you all for the advice and love. It's been amazing and i'm glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don't know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i'll maybe come around again. But for now I'm going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy's :)",

This included the fact that my parents have been taking money from family to fund a &quot;caretaker&quot; that doesn&#39;t exist.</p>\n\n<p>Suffice to say, this week has been rough. But, the upside is that even through all this, my extended family has been giving me more love than i&#39;ve felt in a while. My grandfather spent this last week &quot;making up for the time i&#39;ve lost.&quot; Encouraging me to spend time with friends and do things I want to do. My aunts and uncles have also been helping me through the week.</p>\n\n<p>Well, Saturday night I sat down with parents to talk. It went badly to say the least. They came clean to me about everything. They told me things I will not repeat here. But they did not apologize. My parents still claim that I some how owed my sister my time. My father even saying &quot;You were put here to be her caretaker&quot;. I won&#39;t lie and say I was composed. After everything i learned I confronted them. On the fact that my sister needed a caretaker. The money my dad was taking from his sister, and a few other things. They denied it or made excuses. And in the end, we ended off in a worse place than before.</p>\n\n<p>Today will be my last time talking to them for a while. After talking with my grandfather and uncle last night, I&#39;m not going back. Later today i&#39;m going there and picking up my stuff and moving in with my grandfather. When I graduate high school i&#39;m planning on leaving the state to go to school. My aunt has told me that the money she was sending my dad will be instead be coming to me from now on. My parents have called me twice since Saturday, neither of them were to apologize and only ask when I was coming home.</p>\n\n<p>I won&#39;t be going back to them. Right now I still feel pretty uneasy about everything but I feel like that will pass. The rest of my family is showing their support to me and honestly, it feel great. But in the end I lost my parents. Over all of this, i&#39;ve learned something that I wished I saw earlier. I don&#39;t hat my sister. In fact I love her with all my heart. I should never have never projected my hate onto her. That was wrong, and someday I hope to make up for it. But for now I need to leave.</p>\n\n<p>So, there&#39;s my update. Thanks again for the support my original post got. I really appreciate everyone who took the time to comment or show me support. Thanks you.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Thank you all so much! I wish I could respond to every single one of you but my lunch only lasts so long. I&#39;ll update tonight how the move out went but until then, thank you all. I want to say that your support has been amazing and your kindness means more to me than anyone could ever imagine.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Late edit: Wow, I never imagined my story would reach the popularity it did. I know it&#39;s kinda cliche and i&#39;ve said it a thousand times but thank you all. </p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>We just got back from moving my things out of my parents house. Every thing I wanted to take my grandpa and uncle helped move and it&#39;s at my grandpa&#39;s house now. I have my birth certificate, social security card, and every other document and record I could think of. My parents were quiet the whole time I was there. Shorty after I arrived my dad left with my sister and my mom only hovered over us silently as me moved. It took a while but as we left she broke down and told me she loved me and would miss me. I hugged her and said goodbye, and that was it. Even now I sit here and think if she really meant it. After this whole week of her not saying anything she waited till the end. I hope she meant it. Right now though, I think I just need to look ahead. Maybe one day me and my parents can reconnect. I hope so.</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>Thank you all for the advice and love. It&#39;s been amazing and i&#39;m glad that through this experience I at least got some positive out of this mess. Will I come back? I don&#39;t know. If something happens and you guys still want an update i&#39;ll maybe come around again. But for now I&#39;m going to move on. For all those out there who shared their stories with me, thank you, and I hope to see you on the other side. See you space cowboy&#39;s :)</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

        "selftext": "I'll try to keep this short. I had a [1967 Impala 4 door](https://i.imgur.com/HLBPpTF.jpg) that I bought in Feb 2019. A couple months ago I bought my first house that had a 2.5 car garage. I moved the car in and started tearing it down for a complete restoration. I had the body in one bay and the chassis in another, plus the whole garage filled with parts. About two months ago my girlfriend came to live with me during this whole crisis and the whole time has hated that car. She wants to park in the garage but I have 2 acres of land with a lot of nice places to park under shady trees or hell even in the barn if it has to be inside. I tell her tough luck its my house and its not like I can just throw it back together real quick. Anyways I was out of town for a couple days on a business trip for the small local company I work for. When I got back, my girlfriend was all smiles. Making me food all the time, doing all the chores, all that. I though maybe she just was happy to have me home but then I realized that I didn't see her car in it's usual spot. I asked her where she parked so I could make sure I mow that area and keep it clean and she said not to worry because she parked in the garage. I asked how and she told me to go check it out. Turns out that while I was gone she hired some people to come over and move everything related to that car, including the drivetrain, body, and chassis and all parts, and take it to the local dump/scrapyard. I was absolutely dumbfounded. I had spent over 11k on that car including new parts, services, and the car itself. I told her that I was going to be taking her to court for that and she brushed me off like I was being dramatic. I told her that its done between us and to pack her things and leave. I admit I was a really angry but I did end up getting a lawyer, and as I have all the receipts for all that money spent and I have her on my house's security cam footage letting the guys in and watching them take it all I think I can win. Her family and friends are absolutely blowing me up saying its just a stupid old piece of junk and that she cannot pay back all that money I spent, and that I should just let it go. But I have been putting all my time, effort, and money into that car for a year and a half now and goddammit if I am not going to get justice for what she did. AITA\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the support and awards and everything. I'm glad I have some people on my side. I got a call from her mom about 20 minutes ago and she told me that i was ruining her daughter's life over a stupid car. I told her she ruined her own life. I've been gathering documentation and stuff and I'm about to head down to the police station and file a report, as suggested by lots here. Once again thank you all\n\nUPDATE : went to the police station last night, was told to come back in the morning. just got back and filed an official report against her for grand larceny and grand theft auto. i showed them all the receipts i had for the car and the footage of her letting the guys come and take it as well as the title for the vehicle in my name. they said they will be in contact with all 3 parties (me, ex gf, and junkyard guys) soon and they will hopefully be able to recover some or all of the car. just have to wait now\n\nHUGE UPDATE : THEY FOUND MY GODDAMN CAR!! the junkyard guys apparently were in the middle of hiding it when the police came to ask them questions. it was on a forklift and they were gonna put it on top of a pile of cars that was hidden behind more piles of cars. they said it was theirs and they had the title, but obviously didnt have the title for it and since they matched the vin on the chassis and body to the vin on my title, it was obviously mine. I know at least one person there has been arrested, i think he was in the camera footage i talked about earlier but idk if it was the boss or whomever or even his specific charge, they also told me they would be looking into this specific junkyard for any other vehicles reported stolen. they said they haven't been able to get in contact with my ex just yet but they're working on it. im just so glad they found my car. luckily i made quite an album of pictures detailing me tearing down the car and so i can use that to prove what parts they had were mine so i can hopefully get most or all of it back. police haven't let me take it back home yet as they say it is evidence or something so hopefully i can get it back eventually. thank you all so much for the support and advice!

        "selftext": "Hello, everyone. First of all, thank you all for the kind words, support and love that everyone has offered and given. These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I've had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I've copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I'll take my leave here. Much love.\n\n\"Reddit! If you're reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I'm sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn't planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn't take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I'm not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them.

These weeks have been the most difficult I have ever experienced and it is with great sadness that I tell you all that my beautiful and cat crazy wife, has passed. I&#39;ve had to cut this short due to character limits, sorry all. But, she did leave all of you a note, Reddit. I&#39;ve copied everything verbatim below. She truly loved everyone and was smiling so much after her first post. I&#39;ll take my leave here. Much love.</p>\n\n<p>&quot;Reddit! If you&#39;re reading this, I am dead. Pretty crazy to be talking to a dead person, eh? It feels a bit strange to be writing this. If this feels a bit disconnected, I&#39;m sorry. I have to take frequent breaks as I get tired pretty quickly now. My husband offered to write these words (such a sweet ham, I know. Be nice to him, okay?). But, I wanted my last words to be written by me. Long story short, we talked to my parents. A lot of people asked about why my husband wasn&#39;t planning the funeral and my parents were taking control. Honestly, my parents didn&#39;t take the news of my passing to come well and I suppose their closure(?) was to try and take control of what they could. I&#39;m not angry at them for it, I understand. They had already pre-paid a large portion of the service and to put it plain and simple, it was a shit hand they were dealt. So, we talked to them. I laid it all out for them and somehow, we reached a compromise. Lots of tears. Lots of hugs. And surprisingly, lots of laughs. They admitted that they had been losing their faith with everything that had happened and their way to attempt to find it again was to take control and &quot;guide me&quot; into the afterlife.

I decided to try a little experiment over the weekend to see what would happen if I tried to meet some of his demands. NOT because I actually thought they were reasonable, but because I increasingly had the sense that the goalposts would just keep moving and that I was playing a losing game. So, Saturday morning, I went to the salon for a glow-up (haircut, fresh highlights, mani/pedi) then went to the farmer's market to pick up fresh flowers for our table and assorted other gourmet ingredients. Saturday is usually our date night out but I suggested we stay in so I could make us a special dinner, steakhouse style (lobster bisque, bread basket with several types of rolls/savory muffins made from scratch, crab-stuffed mushrooms, filet mignon, au gratin potatoes, white chocolate mousse topped with raspberries). I wore a lavender (his favorite color on me) sheath dress and high heels and fully done hair and makeup. For all that I got a lukewarm \"thanks, it was tasty\" and a kiss on the cheek. Of course I did all the serving and cleanup.\n\nSunday we usually go out but he suggested I make us brunch at home. So I made French-press coffee, mimosas with fresh-squeezed orange juice, Belgian waffles with a bananas Foster topping, eggs scrambled with parmesan and fresh herbs from our garden, roasted fingerling potatoes, and maple-glazed bacon. I wore a blue sleeveless sundress, wedge sandals, again did my hair and makeup. Again I got a \"thanks, it's good\" and no help with serving or cleanup.\n\nAfterwards I asked if this is what he had in mind when he critiqued me before. He said that it was a start, but that I was \"acting very entitled for wanting credit for basic adulting.\"\n\nHe then dropped a bomb that he was being so hard on me because he had realized lately I had a lot to make up for due to my being a \"low-value woman.\" I asked what on earth he meant by that and he said it was because I wasn't a virgin when we met. \n\nWHAT?!?!\n\nKeep in mind we started dating at 21, neither of us claimed to be virgins or stated that as an expectation. Except for very religious people (neither of us is) I don't think most 21-year-old college students are virgins. I was upfront with him then that I'd had two previous partners, my high school boyfriend (we went our separate ways when we went to different colleges in different parts of the country) and another boyfriend I'd had my first year of college. And that's it, both committed relationships and nothing casual. \n\nHe then went on to say that because of my low value, I was going to need to be making it up to him for the rest of my life. That I didn't deserve monogamy or equal treatment and that I was lucky that anyone at all wanted to marry me. And - that he's \"connected\" with someone from work so if I wanted to keep him I'd better step up.\n\nI told him it didn't sound like there was anything to keep if he no longer loved me (or even liked or respected me). Told him to leave and he said he would gladly go to his girlfriend's place.\n\nI know SO many people here insisted he was having an affair and I just didn't want to see it, that his \"complaints\" were really all part of a campaign to distance himself from me. I feel SO foolish for just thinking he was going through a stressful time at work or that he genuinely wanted to work on our marriage.\n\nAnyway I have taken the week off from work to get my head together. Have an appointment with a lawyer tomorrow. Canceled the marriage counseling appointment but got a referral to an individual therapist who can do an intake session with me later in the week. He (and the girlfriend apparently) are coming this evening to get more of his clothes and things so I have to brace myself for that.\n\nAlso, please be assured I do NOT think I am low-value in any way. I let my husband make me think less of myself on some levels for a short time but now I truly see it was a \"him\" problem. Obviously we don't share the same goals and values and he has become someone I don't recognize. \n\nI know the divorce won't be fun or easy, but I will be okay. Thank you all for helping me see that I was being played before I wasted too much more time in a marriage that was already over.",

I've been playing League of Legends for 6 years under the alias Squid Corona - squids are my favourite animal and Corona, believe it or not, is my real life surname. \n\nAs I'm sure everyone is well aware, there is a global pandemic called COVID-19 or, as very inconveniently for me, better known as Coronavirus. Trust me, I've heard all the jokes possible from friends and co-workers. \n\nAt the start of 2019 I managed to change my in-game name to just \"Corona\" as I thought the shorter version of my name was nicer, worked well with telling my real life friends to add me on League, as they all know it's my surname and I think Corona is a cool name so why not have just that. I had to use one of those third party sites to check the name and stay up till midnight in order to secure my family name in League (as a side note, Riot should really consider implementing a bot-detect system to stop name sniping).\n\nI'm by most descriptions a casual player - I play one or two games a day of normal draft pick, almost always with friends just as a way of relaxing after work. On the 1st of April, I try to login to be greeted with a message telling me I need to change my name in order to proceed. I thought it was amusing at first, as almost every game a player would say in chat \"nice name\" to me, but I just shrugged my shoulders and emailed Riot in the hopes of them agreeing that it was a funny situation, and my name would be white-listed. \n\nAfter two weeks of back and forth with multiple \"Player Support Specialists\", I was told that they had come to the conclusion that my name would not get white-listed and that I would have to change it if I wanted to keep playing League of Legends. **This is specially stupid since in other regions, players with the name Corona are still active and playing.**\n\nThis to me is all very disappointing. I haven't chosen the name \"Corona\" for any reason, and certainly haven't done it during the covid-19 outbreak. I feel like Riot are just sticking a big middle finger to me and telling me that my family name is inappropriate to be a part of their game. I'm posting this to reddit because I want to know if the community really feels offended by the summoner name \"Corona\", or if I'm right in feeling a mild rage and sense of unfairness.\n\nEDIT: here's proof of communication: https://imgur.com/a/OE9l8sc\nProof of ID has also been privately sent.\n\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the pressure reddit, Riot has given me my account back!",

I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.\n\nThose close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.\n\nTo Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.\n\nTo CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.\n\nTo the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these \"millennial blog posts\": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.\n\nTo WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNote: I can't seem to get a hold of mods and they keep fucking removing the post.

        "selftext": "###TL;DR /r/IAmA, /r/AskReddit, /r/funny, /r/Books, /r/science, /r/Music, /r/gaming, /r/history, /r/Art, /r/videos, /r/gadgets, /r/todayilearned, /r/Documentaries, /r/LifeProTips, /r/Jokes, /r/pics, /r/Dataisbeautiful and /r/movies have all made themselves private in response to the removal of an administrator key to the AMA process, /u/chooter, but also due to underlying resentment against the admins for running the site poorly - being uncommunicative, and disregarding the thousands of moderators who keep the site running. In addition, /r/listentothis has [disabled all submissions](/r/listentothis/comments/3bxknx/with_regret_for_the_time_being_all_submissions/), and [so has /r/pics](/r/pics/comments/3by69q/due_to_recent_events_rpics_will_not_be_allowing/). /r/Jokes has [announced its support](/r/Jokes/comments/3bxqro/statement_from_the_moderates_regarding_the/) (~~but has not gone private~~ and has also gone private). Major subreddits, including /r/4chan, /r/circlejerk and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, have also expressed solidarity through going private. [See here for a further list](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/).\n\n***\n\n###What happened?\n\nAt approximately 5pm UTC, 1pm EST, on Thursday the 2^nd of July, 2015, the moderators of /r/IAmA took their subreddit, which is one of the default set, private. This means that only a very small number of people (consisting of the moderators of /r/IAmA, as well as any pre-approved users) could view and post to the subreddit, making it for all intents and purposes shut down; any other redditors would just see [this page](http://i.imgur.com/DX4S7VF.png). Just after that, a [thread was posted to this subreddit](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/), asking whether anyone knew why it had happened. /u/karmanaut, top mod of /r/IAmA, responded with [an explanation of why they took the subreddit private](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d).\n\n\n### Why was /r/IAmA made private, then?\n\nThe situation was explained [here](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d) by /u/karmanaut: the mods of /r/IAmA had just found out that without prior warning, /u/chooter, or Victoria, had been released from her position at reddit. They felt that they, along with the other subreddits that host AMAs, should have been warned beforehand, if only so that they could have someone or something in place to handle the transition. /u/karmanaut went on to say that many of the mods affected by this do not believe that the admins understand how heavily /u/chooter was relied upon to allow AMAs to go smoothly - something which is outlined below.  Without her, they found themselves in a difficult situation, which is exemplifed by what happened today:\n\n> We had a number of AMAs scheduled for today that Victoria was supposed to help with, and they are all left absolutely high and dry. She was still willing to help them today (before the sub was shut down, of course) even without being paid or required to do so. Just a sign of how much she is committed to what she does. \n\nAs a result of this, the mods therefore took /r/IAmA private, stating their reasoning as follows:\n\n>  for /r/IAMA to work the way it currently does, we need Victoria. Without her, we need to figure out a different way for it to work\n\n> we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.\n\n###Who is /u/chooter, and why was she so important to the functioning of IAmA?\n\n/u/chooter(/about/team#user/chooter), featured [in our wiki](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions#wiki_who_is_victoria.3F_why_is_she_mentioned_in_so_many_amas.3F) is [Victoria Taylor](http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/reddit-victoria-taylor-ethan-hawke-ama/), who was, until today, Director of Talent at reddit. However, her essential role was to act as liaison between reddit, IAmA, and any members of the public that wanted to do AMAs; she therefore helped to set up AMAs with celebrities, and, if they were not too familiar with computers (like Bill Murray), she may help them out, both over the phone and in person.\n\n\n\n**Links of interest:** \n\n* [reddit blog post announcing her hire](http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/welcome-new-recruit-victoria-keeper-of.html)\n\n* [Victoria's AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/) ([cached](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bjPOP7ZaVd0J:https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa+&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gl=rs))\n\nVictoria was important to AMAs for a number of major reasons: firstly, she provided concrete proof of the identity of a celebrity doing an AMA, and made sure that it was not a second party purporting to be the celebrity; she was also a direct line of contact to the admins, allowing the moderators of AMA to quickly resolve an issue encountered during an AMA (the consequences of the absence of which were [bad](/r/IAmA/comments/1zg3b8/gabe_newell_ama_100_pm_pst/cftfbio) - ([screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/UtV7fvg.png)). Victoria also was the channel for the scheduling of AMAs by third parties, and she would ensure both that an AMA was up to scratch before it was posted, and that the person doing the AMA understood exactly what it entailed. Without her, the mods of /r/IAmA say that they will be overwhelmed, and that they may even need to limit AMAs.\n\n###Why did she leave reddit so abruptly?\n\nThe short answer: no-one, excluding a select few of the administrative team, knows precisely why /u/chooter was removed as an admin, and that will almost certainly continue to be the case until the admins get their house in order: both parties are at being professional in that they aren't talking about the reasons why it occurred.\n\n###What have the reactions across the rest of reddit been?\n\nSo far, **/r/AskReddit, /r/funny, /r/Books, /r/science, /r/Music, /r/gaming, /r/history, /r/Art, /r/videos, /r/gadgets, /r/todayilearned, /r/Documentaries, /r/LifeProTips, /r/jokes, /r/pics, /r/Dataisbeautiful, and /r/movies have followed /r/IAmA in making themselves private**. In addition, /r/listentothis has [disabled all submissions](/r/listentothis/comments/3bxknx/with_regret_for_the_time_being_all_submissions/), and [so has /r/pics](/r/pics/comments/3by69q/due_to_recent_events_rpics_will_not_be_allowing/)and /r/Jokes has [announced its support](/r/Jokes/comments/3bxqro/statement_from_the_moderates_regarding_the/) (but has not gone private). Major subreddits, including /r/4chan, /r/circlejerk and /r/ImGoingToHellForThis, have also expressed solidarity through going private. [See here for a further list](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/).\n\nMany other subreddits were also reliant on /u/chooter's services as an official contact point for the organisation of AMAs on reddit, including /r/science, /r/books, and /r/Music. So, in order to express their dissatisfaction with the difficulties they have been placed in without /u/chooter, similar to /r/IAmA, they have made themselves private. \n\n/u/nallen, lead mod of /r/science, explained that subreddit's reasoning in this way:\n\n> To back this up, I am the mod in /r/science that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the /r/Science AMAs; Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins.  If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be \"Sorry, I can't help.\"  \n\n> Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit. \n\nIn turn, /u/imakuram, /r/books moderator, had this to say:\n\n> This seems to be a seriously stupid decision. We have several AMAs upcoming in /r/books and have no idea how to contact the authors.\n\n/r/AskReddit's message expressed a similar sentiment:\n\n> As a statment on the treatment of moderators by Reddit administrators, as well as a lack of communication and proper moderation tools, /r/AskReddit has decided to go private for the time being. Please see [this post](/r/IdeasForAskreddit/comments/3bxj7n/megathread_subreddit_shutdown/) in /r/ideasforaskreddit for more discussion.\n\n/r/Books took [the decision as a community to go dark](https://archive.is/DVzu8).\n\n/r/todayilearned posted this statement:\n\n> The way the admins failed to communicate with AMA's mods and left them without a way to contact the people that were going to do them illustrates the disconnect between admins and the moderators they depend on. It showed disrespect for the people with planned amas, the moderators, and the users. A little communication can go a long way.   There's so much more than that, but one thing at a time.\n\nMuch of the *metasphere*, a term for the parts of reddit that focus on the content produced by reddit itself, has also reacted to these happenings, with threads from [/r/SubredditDrama](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/) and [/r/Drama](/r/Drama/comments/3bw66c/admin_chooter_aka_victoria_has_been_let_go_from/), as well as the (currently private) subreddit /r/circlejerk, which parodies and satirises reddit, adding a message to [make fun of the action](https://i.imgur.com/1lsMqw0.png).\n\n###Why is this all happening so suddenly? \n\nAs much as Victoria is loved, this reaction is not all a result of her departure: there is a feeling among many of the moderators of reddit that the admins do not respect the work that is put in by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who maintain the communities of the 9,656 active subreddits, which they feel is expressed by, among other things, the lack of communication between them and the admins, and their disregard of the thousands of mods who keep reddit's communities going. /u/nallen's response above is an example of one of the many responses to these issues. \n\nThe moderation tools on reddit are another of the larger contention points between the mods and admins - they are frequently saidby those who use them often to be a decade out of date. /u/creesch, one of the creators of the /r/toolbox extension, an extension which attempts to fill much of the gap left in those moderator tools, said this:\n\n> This is a non answer and a great example of reddit as a company not being in touch with the actually website anymore. ... When a majority of the people that run your site rely on a third party extension [/r/toolbox] something is clearly wrong. ...\n\n> Another great example of how much reddit cares about their assets is reddit companion. Which at the time of writing has around [154,302 installations, is utterly broken and hasn't been updated since February 21, 2013](http://i.imgur.com/sdMda6p.png), the most ridiculous thing? It isn't hard to fix [people tried to do the work for reddit since it is open source but they simply have been ignoring those pull requests since 2013](https://github.com/reddit/reddit-companion/pulls). \n\n> And honestly, I get that they might not have resources for a silly extension. But the fact that they keep it around on the chrome store while it is utterly broken and only recently removed it from the reddit footer baffles me. I think I messaged them about them about a year ago, it took them another year to actually update the footer with apps and tools they are (still) working on. \n\n/u/K_Lobstah, another moderator, also expressed frustration earlier today in [a submission to /r/self](/r/self/comments/3bvkf0/stop_throwing_beer_cans_on_my_lawn_while_im/) over the lack of responses from the admins concerning the issue of the new search UI, which has been strongly disliked by redditors in [the /r/changelog post](/r/changelog/comments/3bsm11/reddit_change_new_search_results_page/).\n\n> Stop throwing beer cans on our lawns while we try to mow them. Use /r/beta[1] as a Beta; listen to the feedback. Fix the things that need fixing, give us the tools we need to do even the simplest of tasks, like reading messages from subscribers.\n\n> Stop relying on volunteers and third-parties to build the most important and useful tools for moderating this site.\n\n> Help us help you.\n\n###What's happening now?\n\n/u/kn0thing has provided a response from the admins [here](/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq6ekp):\n\n> We don't talk about specific employees, but I do want you to know that I'm here to triage AMA requests in the interim. All AMA inquiries go to AMA@reddit.com where we have a team in place.\n    \n> I posted this on [a mod sub] but I'm reposting here:\n    \n> We get that losing Victoria has a significant impact on the way you manage your community. I'd really like to understand how we can help solve these problems, because I know r/IAMA thrived before her and will thrive after.\n    \n> We're prepared to help coordinate and schedule AMAs. I've got the inbound coming through my inbox right now and many of the people who come on to do AMAs are excited to do them without assistance (most recently, the noteworthy Channing Tatum AMA).\n\nThe moderators of an increasing number of default subreddits have been making them private, in an attempt to draw the admins' attention to how they have been mismanaging the site with a substantive demonstrative act - since for many years, they've been trying to get the admins to listen normally with relatively little improvement.\n\n**Update:** the admins [seem to have replied to some of the mods' concerns](/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bytne/the_admins_have_broken_the_silence_with_posts_to/), and some subreddits, such as /r/pics, are content with that, and so have returned themselves to being public (although there were [manufactured](/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c09rj/the_paopics_screenshots_arent_real/) rumours that there was administrative impetus behind its return). However, others have seen these promises from the admins as more of the same sorts of unfulfilled promises that helped create the unstable situation that brought this affair about.\n\n/r/science also made itself public again, in order to avoid interfering with plans for an AMA with the Lancet Comission at 1pm EST, July 3rd, on \"Climate Impacts on Health, and What To Do About It\".\n***\n\nVictoria was beloved by many redditors, and people are understandably upset - but remember that we still don't know why it happened. What is an issue is how this problem for the admins was handled; whether or not it was an emergency for the admins, the IAmA mod team were not given warning, and weren't informed of the alternative contact location early enough, which gave them a sizeable logistical problem - one which they took themselves private to deal with.",

Major subreddits, including <a href=\"/r/4chan\">/r/4chan</a>, <a href=\"/r/circlejerk\">/r/circlejerk</a> and <a href=\"/r/ImGoingToHellForThis\">/r/ImGoingToHellForThis</a>, have also expressed solidarity through going private. <a href=\"/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/\">See here for a further list</a>.</h3>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>What happened?</h3>\n\n<p>At approximately 5pm UTC, 1pm EST, on Thursday the 2<sup>nd</sup> of July, 2015, the moderators of <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a> took their subreddit, which is one of the default set, private. This means that only a very small number of people (consisting of the moderators of <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a>, as well as any pre-approved users) could view and post to the subreddit, making it for all intents and purposes shut down; any other redditors would just see <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/DX4S7VF.png\">this page</a>. Just after that, a <a href=\"/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/\">thread was posted to this subreddit</a>, asking whether anyone knew why it had happened. <a href=\"/u/karmanaut\">/u/karmanaut</a>, top mod of <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a>, responded with <a href=\"/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d\">an explanation of why they took the subreddit private</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Why was <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a> made private, then?</h3>\n\n<p>The situation was explained <a href=\"/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq204d\">here</a> by <a href=\"/u/karmanaut\">/u/karmanaut</a>: the mods of <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a> had just found out that without prior warning, <a href=\"/u/chooter\">/u/chooter</a>, or Victoria, had been released from her position at reddit. They felt that they, along with the other subreddits that host AMAs, should have been warned beforehand, if only so that they could have someone or something in place to handle the transition. <a href=\"/u/karmanaut\">/u/karmanaut</a> went on to say that many of the mods affected by this do not believe that the admins understand how heavily <a href=\"/u/chooter\">/u/chooter</a> was relied upon to allow AMAs to go smoothly - something which is outlined below.  Without her, they found themselves in a difficult situation, which is exemplifed by what happened today:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We had a number of AMAs scheduled for today that Victoria was supposed to help with, and they are all left absolutely high and dry. She was still willing to help them today (before the sub was shut down, of course) even without being paid or required to do so. Just a sign of how much she is committed to what she does. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a result of this, the mods therefore took <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a> private, stating their reasoning as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>for <a href=\"/r/IAMA\">/r/IAMA</a> to work the way it currently does, we need Victoria. Without her, we need to figure out a different way for it to work</p>\n\n<p>we will need to go through our processes and see what can be done without her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Who is <a href=\"/u/chooter\">/u/chooter</a>, and why was she so important to the functioning of IAmA?</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/chooter\">/u/chooter</a>(/about/team#user/chooter), featured <a href=\"/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions#wiki_who_is_victoria.3F_why_is_she_mentioned_in_so_many_amas.3F\">in our wiki</a> is <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/reddit-victoria-taylor-ethan-hawke-ama/\">Victoria Taylor</a>, who was, until today, Director of Talent at reddit. However, her essential role was to act as liaison between reddit, IAmA, and any members of the public that wanted to do AMAs; she therefore helped to set up AMAs with celebrities, and, if they were not too familiar with computers (like Bill Murray), she may help them out, both over the phone and in person.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Links of interest:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.redditblog.com/2013/06/welcome-new-recruit-victoria-keeper-of.html\">reddit blog post announcing her hire</a></p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa/\">Victoria&#39;s AMA</a> (<a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bjPOP7ZaVd0J:https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2fgsv2/i_am_victoria_from_reddit_amaa+&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gl=rs\">cached</a>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Victoria was important to AMAs for a number of major reasons: firstly, she provided concrete proof of the identity of a celebrity doing an AMA, and made sure that it was not a second party purporting to be the celebrity; she was also a direct line of contact to the admins, allowing the moderators of AMA to quickly resolve an issue encountered during an AMA (the consequences of the absence of which were <a href=\"/r/IAmA/comments/1zg3b8/gabe_newell_ama_100_pm_pst/cftfbio\">bad</a> - (<a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/UtV7fvg.png\">screenshot</a>). Victoria also was the channel for the scheduling of AMAs by third parties, and she would ensure both that an AMA was up to scratch before it was posted, and that the person doing the AMA understood exactly what it entailed. Without her, the mods of <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a> say that they will be overwhelmed, and that they may even need to limit AMAs.</p>\n\n<h3>Why did she leave reddit so abruptly?</h3>\n\n<p>The short answer: no-one, excluding a select few of the administrative team, knows precisely why <a href=\"/u/chooter\">/u/chooter</a> was removed as an admin, and that will almost certainly continue to be the case until the admins get their house in order: both parties are at being professional in that they aren&#39;t talking about the reasons why it occurred.</p>\n\n<h3>What have the reactions across the rest of reddit been?</h3>\n\n<p>So far, <strong><a href=\"/r/AskReddit\">/r/AskReddit</a>, <a href=\"/r/funny\">/r/funny</a>, <a href=\"/r/Books\">/r/Books</a>, <a href=\"/r/science\">/r/science</a>, <a href=\"/r/Music\">/r/Music</a>, <a href=\"/r/gaming\">/r/gaming</a>, <a href=\"/r/history\">/r/history</a>, <a href=\"/r/Art\">/r/Art</a>, <a href=\"/r/videos\">/r/videos</a>, <a href=\"/r/gadgets\">/r/gadgets</a>, <a href=\"/r/todayilearned\">/r/todayilearned</a>, <a href=\"/r/Documentaries\">/r/Documentaries</a>, <a href=\"/r/LifeProTips\">/r/LifeProTips</a>, <a href=\"/r/jokes\">/r/jokes</a>, <a href=\"/r/pics\">/r/pics</a>, <a href=\"/r/Dataisbeautiful\">/r/Dataisbeautiful</a>, and <a href=\"/r/movies\">/r/movies</a> have followed <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a> in making themselves private</strong>. In addition, <a href=\"/r/listentothis\">/r/listentothis</a> has <a href=\"/r/listentothis/comments/3bxknx/with_regret_for_the_time_being_all_submissions/\">disabled all submissions</a>, and <a href=\"/r/pics/comments/3by69q/due_to_recent_events_rpics_will_not_be_allowing/\">so has /r/pics</a>and <a href=\"/r/Jokes\">/r/Jokes</a> has <a href=\"/r/Jokes/comments/3bxqro/statement_from_the_moderates_regarding_the/\">announced its support</a> (but has not gone private). Major subreddits, including <a href=\"/r/4chan\">/r/4chan</a>, <a href=\"/r/circlejerk\">/r/circlejerk</a> and <a href=\"/r/ImGoingToHellForThis\">/r/ImGoingToHellForThis</a>, have also expressed solidarity through going private. <a href=\"/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bxjyu/list_of_subreddits_suddenly_going_private/\">See here for a further list</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Many other subreddits were also reliant on <a href=\"/u/chooter\">/u/chooter</a>&#39;s services as an official contact point for the organisation of AMAs on reddit, including <a href=\"/r/science\">/r/science</a>, <a href=\"/r/books\">/r/books</a>, and <a href=\"/r/Music\">/r/Music</a>. So, in order to express their dissatisfaction with the difficulties they have been placed in without <a href=\"/u/chooter\">/u/chooter</a>, similar to <a href=\"/r/IAmA\">/r/IAmA</a>, they have made themselves private. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/nallen\">/u/nallen</a>, lead mod of <a href=\"/r/science\">/r/science</a>, explained that subreddit&#39;s reasoning in this way:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>To back this up, I am the mod in <a href=\"/r/science\">/r/science</a> that organizes all of the science AMAs, and I am going to have meaningful problems in the <a href=\"/r/Science\">/r/Science</a> AMAs; Victoria was the only line of communication with the admins.  If someone wants to get analytics for an AMA the answer will be &quot;Sorry, I can&#39;t help.&quot;  </p>\n\n<p>Dropping this on all of us in the AMA sphere feels like an enormous slap to those of us who put in massive amounts of time to bring quality content to reddit. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In turn, <a href=\"/u/imakuram\">/u/imakuram</a>, <a href=\"/r/books\">/r/books</a> moderator, had this to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This seems to be a seriously stupid decision. We have several AMAs upcoming in <a href=\"/r/books\">/r/books</a> and have no idea how to contact the authors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/AskReddit\">/r/AskReddit</a>&#39;s message expressed a similar sentiment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a statment on the treatment of moderators by Reddit administrators, as well as a lack of communication and proper moderation tools, <a href=\"/r/AskReddit\">/r/AskReddit</a> has decided to go private for the time being. Please see <a href=\"/r/IdeasForAskreddit/comments/3bxj7n/megathread_subreddit_shutdown/\">this post</a> in <a href=\"/r/ideasforaskreddit\">/r/ideasforaskreddit</a> for more discussion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/Books\">/r/Books</a> took <a href=\"https://archive.is/DVzu8\">the decision as a community to go dark</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/todayilearned\">/r/todayilearned</a> posted this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The way the admins failed to communicate with AMA&#39;s mods and left them without a way to contact the people that were going to do them illustrates the disconnect between admins and the moderators they depend on. It showed disrespect for the people with planned amas, the moderators, and the users. A little communication can go a long way.   There&#39;s so much more than that, but one thing at a time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Much of the <em>metasphere</em>, a term for the parts of reddit that focus on the content produced by reddit itself, has also reacted to these happenings, with threads from <a href=\"/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bwgjf/riama_set_to_private_over_mod_firing/\">/r/SubredditDrama</a> and <a href=\"/r/Drama/comments/3bw66c/admin_chooter_aka_victoria_has_been_let_go_from/\">/r/Drama</a>, as well as the (currently private) subreddit <a href=\"/r/circlejerk\">/r/circlejerk</a>, which parodies and satirises reddit, adding a message to <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/1lsMqw0.png\">make fun of the action</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Why is this all happening so suddenly?</h3>\n\n<p>As much as Victoria is loved, this reaction is not all a result of her departure: there is a feeling among many of the moderators of reddit that the admins do not respect the work that is put in by the thousands of unpaid volunteers who maintain the communities of the 9,656 active subreddits, which they feel is expressed by, among other things, the lack of communication between them and the admins, and their disregard of the thousands of mods who keep reddit&#39;s communities going. <a href=\"/u/nallen\">/u/nallen</a>&#39;s response above is an example of one of the many responses to these issues. </p>\n\n<p>The moderation tools on reddit are another of the larger contention points between the mods and admins - they are frequently saidby those who use them often to be a decade out of date. <a href=\"/u/creesch\">/u/creesch</a>, one of the creators of the <a href=\"/r/toolbox\">/r/toolbox</a> extension, an extension which attempts to fill much of the gap left in those moderator tools, said this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a non answer and a great example of reddit as a company not being in touch with the actually website anymore. ... When a majority of the people that run your site rely on a third party extension [<a href=\"/r/toolbox\">/r/toolbox</a>] something is clearly wrong. ...</p>\n\n<p>Another great example of how much reddit cares about their assets is reddit companion. Which at the time of writing has around <a href=\"http://i.imgur.com/sdMda6p.png\">154,302 installations, is utterly broken and hasn&#39;t been updated since February 21, 2013</a>, the most ridiculous thing? It isn&#39;t hard to fix <a href=\"https://github.com/reddit/reddit-companion/pulls\">people tried to do the work for reddit since it is open source but they simply have been ignoring those pull requests since 2013</a>. </p>\n\n<p>And honestly, I get that they might not have resources for a silly extension. But the fact that they keep it around on the chrome store while it is utterly broken and only recently removed it from the reddit footer baffles me. I think I messaged them about them about a year ago, it took them another year to actually update the footer with apps and tools they are (still) working on. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/K_Lobstah\">/u/K_Lobstah</a>, another moderator, also expressed frustration earlier today in <a href=\"/r/self/comments/3bvkf0/stop_throwing_beer_cans_on_my_lawn_while_im/\">a submission to /r/self</a> over the lack of responses from the admins concerning the issue of the new search UI, which has been strongly disliked by redditors in <a href=\"/r/changelog/comments/3bsm11/reddit_change_new_search_results_page/\">the /r/changelog post</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Stop throwing beer cans on our lawns while we try to mow them. Use <a href=\"/r/beta\">/r/beta</a>[1] as a Beta; listen to the feedback. Fix the things that need fixing, give us the tools we need to do even the simplest of tasks, like reading messages from subscribers.</p>\n\n<p>Stop relying on volunteers and third-parties to build the most important and useful tools for moderating this site.</p>\n\n<p>Help us help you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>What&#39;s happening now?</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"/u/kn0thing\">/u/kn0thing</a> has provided a response from the admins <a href=\"/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/csq6ekp\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We don&#39;t talk about specific employees, but I do want you to know that I&#39;m here to triage AMA requests in the interim. All AMA inquiries go to <a href=\"mailto:AMA@reddit.com\">AMA@reddit.com</a> where we have a team in place.</p>\n\n<p>I posted this on [a mod sub] but I&#39;m reposting here:</p>\n\n<p>We get that losing Victoria has a significant impact on the way you manage your community. I&#39;d really like to understand how we can help solve these problems, because I know <a href=\"/r/IAMA\">r/IAMA</a> thrived before her and will thrive after.</p>\n\n<p>We&#39;re prepared to help coordinate and schedule AMAs. I&#39;ve got the inbound coming through my inbox right now and many of the people who come on to do AMAs are excited to do them without assistance (most recently, the noteworthy Channing Tatum AMA).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The moderators of an increasing number of default subreddits have been making them private, in an attempt to draw the admins&#39; attention to how they have been mismanaging the site with a substantive demonstrative act - since for many years, they&#39;ve been trying to get the admins to listen normally with relatively little improvement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> the admins <a href=\"/r/SubredditDrama/comments/3bytne/the_admins_have_broken_the_silence_with_posts_to/\">seem to have replied to some of the mods&#39; concerns</a>, and some subreddits, such as <a href=\"/r/pics\">/r/pics</a>, are content with that, and so have returned themselves to being public (although there were <a href=\"/r/Blackout2015/comments/3c09rj/the_paopics_screenshots_arent_real/\">manufactured</a> rumours that there was administrative impetus behind its return). However, others have seen these promises from the admins as more of the same sorts of unfulfilled promises that helped create the unstable situation that brought this affair about.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/r/science\">/r/science</a> also made itself public again, in order to avoid interfering with plans for an AMA with the Lancet Comission at 1pm EST, July 3rd, on &quot;Climate Impacts on Health, and What To Do About It&quot;.</p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Victoria was beloved by many redditors, and people are understandably upset - but remember that we still don&#39;t know why it happened. What is an issue is how this problem for the admins was handled; whether or not it was an emergency for the admins, the IAmA mod team were not given warning, and weren&#39;t informed of the alternative contact location early enough, which gave them a sizeable logistical problem - one which they took themselves private to deal with.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Thanks to all who have given a variety of responses based on actual right-wing websites or their own experiences. I certainly don\u2019t think that there is anything \u201cbig\u201d coming. I was once a more conspiracy-minded person, but have realized over the years that most big, wild conspiracy theories are really just distractions from the day-to-day injustices of the world. However, given recent events, my own mother\u2019s engagement with these theories makes me anxious about the possibility of more actions similar to the attack on the Capitol. Again, I\u2019m unsure of  which theory she subscribes to, but as someone who left the small town I was raised in for a city, 15 years ago, I am beginning to realize just how vast a difference there is present in the information and misinformation that spreads in different types of communities.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

As Oven says goodbye, his brothers/sisters prepare to start all kinds of investigations on Niji and Yonji's bodies (using knives, saws, hammers, lasers...).\n\nChapter starts with Luffy talking, although we cannot see him close-up. The sound of the drums is getting louder.\n\nLuffy: \"What happened? I...\n\nWhy? ...How am I able to get up if I lost.\n\nI suddenly feel so much fun...\n\nAhahahaha!!\"\n\nAs Luffy speaks, we see in a distant shot that black lightnings come out of Luffy's body.\n\nZunesha is still with the World Government ships in the sea near Wanokuni. Momonosuke looks at the roof of Onigashima, he's very upset and even trembles.\n\nMomonosuke: \"Joy Boy\u2026!?\n\nDo you mean Luffy!?\"\n\nYamato: \"Is that... what Zunesha said!!?\"\n\nIn the \u201cPleasure Hall\u201d of the Leftbrain Tower, we see that Some is taking care of Sanji (he is lying on a futon). Suddenly, Sanji gets up because he senses something and looks up.\n\nSome: \"Eh!\n\nKyaah!!\"\n\nSanji: \"...!!\n\nHah, hah...\n\nLuffy...!?\"\n\nOn the Live Floor, Luffy's allies are also feeling something. Kid, Law and Hyougorou look up.\n\nKid: \"What!?\"\n\nHyougorou: \"Ah...\n\nIs that Straw Hat...!?\"\n\nMarco also feels something and tells it to Nami and Tama, who are crying as they hug.\n\nMarco: \"Straw Hat...!?\n\nHey! He is still breathing.\n\nNami: \"Is Luffy alive!!?\"\n\nTama: \"Is he really alive!!? Aniki~~~\"\n\nWe travel now to the Holy Land of Mary Geoise, to the \u201cRoom of Authority\u201d in Pangea Castle. Gorousei continues talking about the situation in Wanokuni. One of them wonders if it's worth it losing a top agent and anger Kaidou. Gorousei with dreadlocks replies that it's worth it, especially considering the future that this situation may lead to.\n\nSwordsman Gorousei: \"The \u201cWorld Government\u201d tries to keep the \u201cGomu Gomu no Mi\u201d with them in every era...\nBut, somehow, the fruit always gets away.\nAnd 800 years have passed...!!\"\n\nGorousei with big beard and mustache: \"It's like if that \u201cAkuma no Mi\u201d tries to escape from them.\"\n\nGorousei with a spot on his head: \"It is possible, since we know Zoan fruits have minds of their own.\n\nAnd that fruit has the name of a \u201cGod\u201d...\n\nThe other name of the \u201cGomu Gomu no Mi\u201d is...\"\n\nBlond Gorousei: \"\u201cHito Hito no Mi\u201d (Human-Human Fruit) Mythical Zoan... Model \u201cNika\u201d.\"\n\nAs the Gorousei says this, in a magnificent and epic double page we see the silhouette of Luffy with the full Moon in the background. His silhouette is identical to Nika's (without weapons in his hands). Although we only see a black silhouette, it's clear that Luffy is laughing. In addition, the sound of drums continues.\n\nLuffy: \"Ahahahahahaha!!!\"\n\nGorousei continues speaking, as we see a close-up of the silhouette of Luffy's face. He's laughing.\n\nGorousei: \"His body has the properties of rubber.\n\nAnd he can fight in any way he wishes... Making people smile wherever he goes.\n\nHe is the \u201cWarrior of Liberation\u201d, also known as...\n\n\u201cNika, the Sun God\u201d.\n\nAwakening will give the rubber body even more \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d.\n\nIt is said that...\n\nit's the most ridiculous power in the world!!\"\n\nCut to the \u201cTreasure Hall\u201d on the 2nd floor of Onigashima castle. Orochi is still trapped under the rubble.\n\nOrochi: \"Hey... Hiyori!!\n\nI... I appreciated Oden too...!!\n\nI was... used by Kaidou!!\n\nLet's run away from here together...!! Now take the needles off...\"\n\nHiyori: \"My father kept his promise, right?\n\nHe believed in the promise you and Kaidou made him to free \u201cWanokuni\u201d.\n\nDuring 5 years, my father was dancing in a funny way...!!\n\nEven against his family!!\n\nMy father kept his promise!!\n\nHe believed in the promise to free them all.\n\nHe even endured 1 hour burning in boiling oil...!!\n\nHe was always laughing... Even if the life of an entire country was hijacked.\n\nMy father endured all that pain alone!!!\"\n\nWe see a small flashback between Oden and Hiyori.\n\nOden: \"What's wrong Hiyori~~~?\"\n\nHiyori: \"Father, are you fine with every body talking bad about you?\"\n\nOden: \"Yeah, I'm fine with it.\n\nWhy you ask...?\n\nThat's because...\n\nI've got you guys by my side!!\"\n\nHiyori: \"Really!? Then let's stay together forever.\"\n\nBack to the present, Orochi talks now.\n\nOrochi: \"Oh yes!!\n\nOden was such a great samurai!!\n\nAs a \u201cShogun\u201d, I shall honor your father...\"\n\nHiyori: \"...\"\n\nHiyori takes off her mask and yells in anger at Orochi while she cries tears of pain.\n\nHiyori: \"My name is \u201cKouzuki Hiyori\u201d!!!\n\nBe silence, you insolent man!!!\"\n\nOrochi: \"Ehhh!!!\"\n\nHiyori: \"Even at times when I had an empty stomach and putting on broken fabric!!\n\nI live proudly up to my father's name!!\n\nYou shouldn't be in \u201cShogun\u201d position for even just one day!!\n\nYou are a pathetic fool!!!\n\nAnd as your foolishness grew, so are the innocent lives perishing in vain!!\"\n\nOrochi is very scared after Hiyori's words.\n\nOrochi: \"You're not going to do anything to me, right!!?\n\nRevenge isn't very popular nowadays!!\n\nAnd even if you kill me, you have no chance of defeating Kaidou!!\"\n\nSuddenly, a little version of Kanjuurou's Kazenbo returns to where Orochi and Hiyori are.\n\nKanjuurou's Kazenbo: \"Orochi-sama...\"\n\nOrochi: \"Huh?\"\n\nKanjuurou's Kazenbo: \"I... fai... led...\"\n\nOrochi: \"Kanjuurou!?\n\nYou returned at the right time!! This turns the tables!!\n\nBurn that woman until she dies!!!\n\nWhat a tragicomedy! Remains of the \u201cKouzuki\u201d, have you seen it?\n\nThis is the \u201cluck\u201d of the strongest!!!\"\n\nKanjuurou's Kazenbo: \"Orochi-sama...\"\n\nOrochi: \"Eh!? Hey!!\n\nWhat the hell are you doing!!!\n\nGyaaa~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!\"\n\nKanjuurou's Kazenbo ignores Orochi's words and instead of going for Hiyori, it goes for Orochi, who begins to burn violently. Hiyori looks at him still with tears in her eyes.\n\nHiyori: \"The \u201cdawn\u201d will come.\"\n\nOrochi : \"Stupid Kanjuurou, what have you done!!!\n\nHiyori, help me!!!\"\n\nHiyori: \"\u201cKouzuki\u201d house... always keeps its promises!!\"\n\nBack to the roof of Onigashima, there we see again the silhouette of Luffy with the full Moon in the background.\n\nLuffy: \"...\n\nI feel like I can do anything I want...!!\n\nMy heartbeat sounds so fun!!\n\nThis is my highest peak...!!\n\nThis is... \u201cGear Fith\u201d!!!\u201d\n\nBack to the Live Floor, a huge blast of Color of the Supreme King Haki comes from above. A lot of black lightnings pierce through the roof and Kaidou's subordinates begin to fall unconscious with foam at the mouth. Kaidou looks worried at the roof.\n\nKaidou: \"What's up there on the roof...!!!\"\n\nIn a huge double spread, we see that the roof begins to break and Luffy's arm appears from the hole. The arm is massive and it grabs Kaidou's body in dragon form without difficulty. Everyone looks at the scene shocked.\n\nKid: \"Straw Hat...!?\"\n\nChopper (crying): \"Luffy~~~~~!!?\"\n\nLuffy pulls Kaidou up (Kaidou's eyes popping out, like a cartoon) and drags him easily to the roof. Luffy then increases his muscle mass (as in the leaked picture) and starts spinning wildly Kaidou's body. Kaidou's face looks again like a cartoon, his eyes are popping out one more time.\n\nLuffy stops spinning and starts slamming Kaidou back and forth on the ground, until Luffy lets go him. Kaidou gets up dizzy, with a bump on his head and little stars coming out of it (again like a cartoon). Luffy can't stop laughing.\n\nLuffy: \"Hah. Hah.\n\nAhahahaha!!\"\n\nKaidou: \"...!!\n\nStraw Hay...!! You are alive...!!\n\nThank you.\n\n\u201cBolo Breath\u201d!!!\"\n\nLuffy: \"Ahahahaha!!\n\nEh?\n\nAaahhhhhh!!!\"\n\nLuffy (who has returned to his normal form) is lying on the ground laughing non-stop, but when he sees Kaidou's \u201cBolo Breath\u201d, he screams surprised. His eyes also pop out like a cartoon, but it's more excessive than Kaidou's (Luffy acts like Jim Carrey's character in the movie \"The Mask\").\n\nLuffy grabs the ground with his hands and stretches it out, causing the ground turns into rubber. Kaidou's \u201cBolo Breath\u201d hits the ground, but since it's now rubber, it doesn't get destroyed and holds back the attack. Luffy changes back to his muscled form and pulls the piece of ground, causing the \u201cBolo Breath\u201d bounces back to Kaidou. There's a huge explosion.\n\nWe finally see Luffy full body clearly. His physical appearance is almost the same as always, although his shirt is now white instead of black (we'll see the actual color that Oda gives to the shirt). His hair now looks like flames and he has that \"vapour collar\" around his neck and under his armpits (like in Gear 4 form). His eyebrows are now curled (similar to Sanji's) and the pupils of his eyes have changed (check leaked picture to see Luffy's face).\n\nLuffy laughs non-stop again as Kaidou stands up. \u201cGear Fith\u201d is officially presented.\n\nLuffy: \"Ahyahyahya!!\"\n\nKaidou: \"...!! I'm sorry for what happened earlier, I was STUPID...!!\n\nI didn't want to win like that.\"\n\nLuffy looks at Kaidou with determination and a smile on his face.\n\nLuffy: \"Don't mention it!!\n\nLet's end this!!!\"\n\nEnd of the chapter.\n\nImages: \n\n[Luffy's Face](https://i.ibb.co/tzt95Jk/1647947371.jpg)\n\n[Luffy's Body](https://i.ibb.co/0c3H7q2/1647947371-1.jpg)",

His silhouette is identical to Nika&#39;s (without weapons in his hands). Although we only see a black silhouette, it&#39;s clear that Luffy is laughing. In addition, the sound of drums continues.</p>\n\n<p>Luffy: &quot;Ahahahahahaha!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Gorousei continues speaking, as we see a close-up of the silhouette of Luffy&#39;s face. He&#39;s laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Gorousei: &quot;His body has the properties of rubber.</p>\n\n<p>And he can fight in any way he wishes... Making people smile wherever he goes.</p>\n\n<p>He is the \u201cWarrior of Liberation\u201d, also known as...</p>\n\n<p>\u201cNika, the Sun God\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>Awakening will give the rubber body even more \u201cstrength\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>It is said that...</p>\n\n<p>it&#39;s the most ridiculous power in the world!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Cut to the \u201cTreasure Hall\u201d on the 2nd floor of Onigashima castle. Orochi is still trapped under the rubble.</p>\n\n<p>Orochi: &quot;Hey... Hiyori!!</p>\n\n<p>I... I appreciated Oden too...!!</p>\n\n<p>I was... used by Kaidou!!</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s run away from here together...!! Now take the needles off...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;My father kept his promise, right?</p>\n\n<p>He believed in the promise you and Kaidou made him to free \u201cWanokuni\u201d.</p>\n\n<p>During 5 years, my father was dancing in a funny way...!!</p>\n\n<p>Even against his family!!</p>\n\n<p>My father kept his promise!!</p>\n\n<p>He believed in the promise to free them all.</p>\n\n<p>He even endured 1 hour burning in boiling oil...!!</p>\n\n<p>He was always laughing... Even if the life of an entire country was hijacked.</p>\n\n<p>My father endured all that pain alone!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>We see a small flashback between Oden and Hiyori.</p>\n\n<p>Oden: &quot;What&#39;s wrong Hiyori~~~?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;Father, are you fine with every body talking bad about you?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Oden: &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine with it.</p>\n\n<p>Why you ask...?</p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s because...</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ve got you guys by my side!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;Really!? Then let&#39;s stay together forever.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Back to the present, Orochi talks now.</p>\n\n<p>Orochi: &quot;Oh yes!!</p>\n\n<p>Oden was such a great samurai!!</p>\n\n<p>As a \u201cShogun\u201d, I shall honor your father...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori takes off her mask and yells in anger at Orochi while she cries tears of pain.</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;My name is \u201cKouzuki Hiyori\u201d!!!</p>\n\n<p>Be silence, you insolent man!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Orochi: &quot;Ehhh!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;Even at times when I had an empty stomach and putting on broken fabric!!</p>\n\n<p>I live proudly up to my father&#39;s name!!</p>\n\n<p>You shouldn&#39;t be in \u201cShogun\u201d position for even just one day!!</p>\n\n<p>You are a pathetic fool!!!</p>\n\n<p>And as your foolishness grew, so are the innocent lives perishing in vain!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Orochi is very scared after Hiyori&#39;s words.</p>\n\n<p>Orochi: &quot;You&#39;re not going to do anything to me, right!!?</p>\n\n<p>Revenge isn&#39;t very popular nowadays!!</p>\n\n<p>And even if you kill me, you have no chance of defeating Kaidou!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly, a little version of Kanjuurou&#39;s Kazenbo returns to where Orochi and Hiyori are.</p>\n\n<p>Kanjuurou&#39;s Kazenbo: &quot;Orochi-sama...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Orochi: &quot;Huh?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kanjuurou&#39;s Kazenbo: &quot;I... fai... led...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Orochi: &quot;Kanjuurou!?</p>\n\n<p>You returned at the right time!! This turns the tables!!</p>\n\n<p>Burn that woman until she dies!!!</p>\n\n<p>What a tragicomedy! Remains of the \u201cKouzuki\u201d, have you seen it?</p>\n\n<p>This is the \u201cluck\u201d of the strongest!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kanjuurou&#39;s Kazenbo: &quot;Orochi-sama...&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Orochi: &quot;Eh!? Hey!!</p>\n\n<p>What the hell are you doing!!!</p>\n\n<p>Gyaaa~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kanjuurou&#39;s Kazenbo ignores Orochi&#39;s words and instead of going for Hiyori, it goes for Orochi, who begins to burn violently. Hiyori looks at him still with tears in her eyes.</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;The \u201cdawn\u201d will come.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Orochi : &quot;Stupid Kanjuurou, what have you done!!!</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori, help me!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Hiyori: &quot;\u201cKouzuki\u201d house... always keeps its promises!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Back to the roof of Onigashima, there we see again the silhouette of Luffy with the full Moon in the background.</p>\n\n<p>Luffy: &quot;...</p>\n\n<p>I feel like I can do anything I want...!!</p>\n\n<p>My heartbeat sounds so fun!!</p>\n\n<p>This is my highest peak...!!</p>\n\n<p>This is... \u201cGear Fith\u201d!!!\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Back to the Live Floor, a huge blast of Color of the Supreme King Haki comes from above. A lot of black lightnings pierce through the roof and Kaidou&#39;s subordinates begin to fall unconscious with foam at the mouth. Kaidou looks worried at the roof.</p>\n\n<p>Kaidou: &quot;What&#39;s up there on the roof...!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>In a huge double spread, we see that the roof begins to break and Luffy&#39;s arm appears from the hole. The arm is massive and it grabs Kaidou&#39;s body in dragon form without difficulty. Everyone looks at the scene shocked.</p>\n\n<p>Kid: &quot;Straw Hat...!?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Chopper (crying): &quot;Luffy~~~~~!!?&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Luffy pulls Kaidou up (Kaidou&#39;s eyes popping out, like a cartoon) and drags him easily to the roof. Luffy then increases his muscle mass (as in the leaked picture) and starts spinning wildly Kaidou&#39;s body. Kaidou&#39;s face looks again like a cartoon, his eyes are popping out one more time.</p>\n\n<p>Luffy stops spinning and starts slamming Kaidou back and forth on the ground, until Luffy lets go him. Kaidou gets up dizzy, with a bump on his head and little stars coming out of it (again like a cartoon). Luffy can&#39;t stop laughing.</p>\n\n<p>Luffy: &quot;Hah. Hah.</p>\n\n<p>Ahahahaha!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kaidou: &quot;...!!</p>\n\n<p>Straw Hay...!! You are alive...!!</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBolo Breath\u201d!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Luffy: &quot;Ahahahaha!!</p>\n\n<p>Eh?</p>\n\n<p>Aaahhhhhh!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Luffy (who has returned to his normal form) is lying on the ground laughing non-stop, but when he sees Kaidou&#39;s \u201cBolo Breath\u201d, he screams surprised. His eyes also pop out like a cartoon, but it&#39;s more excessive than Kaidou&#39;s (Luffy acts like Jim Carrey&#39;s character in the movie &quot;The Mask&quot;).</p>\n\n<p>Luffy grabs the ground with his hands and stretches it out, causing the ground turns into rubber. Kaidou&#39;s \u201cBolo Breath\u201d hits the ground, but since it&#39;s now rubber, it doesn&#39;t get destroyed and holds back the attack. Luffy changes back to his muscled form and pulls the piece of ground, causing the \u201cBolo Breath\u201d bounces back to Kaidou. There&#39;s a huge explosion.</p>\n\n<p>We finally see Luffy full body clearly. His physical appearance is almost the same as always, although his shirt is now white instead of black (we&#39;ll see the actual color that Oda gives to the shirt). His hair now looks like flames and he has that &quot;vapour collar&quot; around his neck and under his armpits (like in Gear 4 form). His eyebrows are now curled (similar to Sanji&#39;s) and the pupils of his eyes have changed (check leaked picture to see Luffy&#39;s face).</p>\n\n<p>Luffy laughs non-stop again as Kaidou stands up. \u201cGear Fith\u201d is officially presented.</p>\n\n<p>Luffy: &quot;Ahyahyahya!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Kaidou: &quot;...!! I&#39;m sorry for what happened earlier, I was STUPID...!!</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t want to win like that.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>Luffy looks at Kaidou with determination and a smile on his face.</p>\n\n<p>Luffy: &quot;Don&#39;t mention it!!</p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s end this!!!&quot;</p>\n\n<p>End of the chapter.</p>\n\n<p>Images: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/tzt95Jk/1647947371.jpg\">Luffy&#39;s Face</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/0c3H7q2/1647947371-1.jpg\">Luffy&#39;s Body</a></p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

We were doing performance and functional testing, and wanted to build a cluster of machines to parallelize the testing.  To get the most of our budget, I offered to build the test machines.  I put together spreadsheets manually entering in price/performance/capacity data to find what would get us the best bang for our buck.  As I was doing that, I thought that the process was tedious and there should be a site to do that.\n\nSo in April 2010 I started working on a side project to plot those CPU price-vs-performance and hard drive price-vs-capacity curves.  I wanted to learn Django and Python better.  My HTML at the time was 90s-ish at best - layouts done with tables and 1x1 transparent pixels, not CSS.  I bought a $20 admin theme off themeforest and wrangled it into what I needed.  I'm colorblind and not a designer by any stretch and that showed in the site.\n\nI started evolving the site to not just plot component curves, but factor in compatibility checks.  I was building new PCs every 3-4 years, and each time it involved coming up to speed with what the latest architectures and chipsets were.  That took time and I felt like part of that process could be automated.\n\nLate December 2010 after a heads-up about this community on HN, I [posted in /r/buildapc for the first time](https://www.reddit.com/r/promos/comments/ec5nl/pick_parts_build_your_pc_compare_prices_and_share/). \nWhen I first started I told my wife that there was a monetization opportunity through retailer affiliate links, and if we were lucky maybe we could go get coffee or see a movie.  I left my job to work on PCPP full-time over eight years ago.\n\nI hired /u/manirelli a bit over seven years ago.  /u/ThoughtA also joined us over four years ago.  (Both those guys are here to answer questions too).  They handle all of the component data entry, community engagement, and a host of other things.

Phil (you can thank him for all the whitespace lol), AJ, Daniel, Jack, Barry, and Nick.  You all rock.  I'm incredibly blessed to get to work with all of you every day.\n\nThis has been such a ride I can't explain it.

There may be some things I can't comment on if they involve agreements or confidential terms.\n\nAnd yes, we're working on an app.  A PWA.  May go native later but no guarantees.

        "selftext": "Last Saturday I posted about building a gaming computer for my son for pretty much just Minecraft.  I had $300 to work with.  I expected a few replies and a few pointers.  The response to that post was unbelievable.  I woke up the next day and my wife told me she needed to silence my phone in the middle of the night.  Over 40K views and over 300 replies.  I now know the meaning of RIP inbox.  I got a lot of great advice from a lot of people.  In the end, it was pretty clear.  I could build it for $300, but it wouldn't be great.  It may play Minecraft, but that's about it.  I would be better off spending more money on a build, and well, my wife and I didnt really have more money to put towards it.\n\n\nLet me start by saying I was messaged by quite a few of you about graphics card, mother boards, processors that they had laying around. Willing to send them to me for nothing, or maybe some shipping.  The generosity of this sub is amazing.  I was never looking for anything but advice, and many of you offered many things.  For that I am very grateful.\n\n\nThen I was messaged by a member of this sub who wishes to remain anonymous.  They offered to purchase a WHOLE BUILD for me.  They said they were around my son's age when they got into building computers and technology.  They now work with computers as their profession and wish they could have shared a similar experience with their dad growing up.   I was skeptical to say the least, but they were very genuine in their message and honestly I don't know how I could have said no.\n\nOver the next few days we sent messages back and forth and he put together a build for my son and I.  My wife kept telling me its crazy and someone was messing with me.  I stayed a little skeptical but I could tell through the conversations we had that this person was truly a good person looking to make a positive impact.\n\nAs of last night, all the parts were ordered and are being shipped straight to my house.

        "selftext": "In the Chicago Bears roast thread, 69memelordharambe420 posted \"There are more Bears than Bears fans.\" That got me thinking: Is that true? And more generally, which teams have fewer fans than there exist whatever they're named after?\n\nTo start, I needed a rough estimate of the number of NFL fans in the world. This turned out to be difficult to find. I found several reasonable estimates that ranged from 200,000,000 to 400,000,000, but the average estimate seems to be about 300,000,000, so I decided to go with that. If you prefer a different estimate, you can easily scale all of the final numbers up or down as needed.\n\nOf those 300,000,000, about [90%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/660525/most-popular-nfl-teams-in-us/), or 270,000,000, consider themselves fans of one team in particular. To find out how these 270,000,000 fans apportion themselves among the 32 teams, I used [this page](http://www.trackalytics.com/the-most-liked-nfl-teams-on-facebook/page/1/), which lists how many likes each team has on Facebook (it lists the St. Louis Rams and the San Diego Chargers but still has accurate numbers for the Facebook likes, I checked), and calculated the total number of likes across the 32 teams: 91,712,968. Then, I took the number of likes for each team and multiplied it by 270,000,000/91,712,968 (then rounded to the nearest whole number) to get the best estimate that I was realistically going to be able to get for the total number of fans that each team has. Here are my results:\n\nBears: There are roughly 12,092,476 Bears fans. There are [eight species of bear, plus the grizzly-polar hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bears). I won't go through all of my calculations, but I came up with a final number of 1,148,364. There are more Bears fans than bears.\n\nLions: There are roughly 5,642,181 Lions fans. The worldwide lion population is somewhere around [20,000](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/lion-decline-map/). There are more Lions fans than lions.\n\nPackers: There are roughly 16,024,215 Packers fans. I don't really feel like doing extensive research on the worldwide meatpacking industry, but the U.S. meatpacking industry employs about 148,100 and there is no way that there are a hundred times that number outside of the country. There are more Packers fans than packers.\n\nVikings: There are roughly 6,200,740 Vikings fans. The Viking Age ended nearly a millennium ago. There are more Vikings fans than Vikings.\n\nCowboys: There are roughly 25,758,315 Cowboys fans. There are currently [less than 9,730](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy#Modern_working_cowboys) cowboys in the United States. Again, there's no way there are over a thousand times more cowboys elsewhere. There are more Cowboys fans than cowboys.\n\nEagles: There are roughly 8,888,974 Eagles fans. This one was a lot harder than I was anticipating, but there are 60 different species of eagle. Two of the most common are the bald eagle (70,000 in the world) and the most common eagle in Europe, the [spotted eagle](http://www.kotkas.ee/species/spotted-eagles) (40,000 in the world). Based on this, I highly doubt that the average eagle species has a worldwide population of more than 100,000, an estimate which would yield a total eagle population across all species of 6,000,000 (remember, this is most likely a wild overestimate). There are almost certainly more Eagles fans than eagles.\n\nGiants: There are roughly 11,690,931 Giants fans. Giants are mythological creatures. There are more Giants fans than giants.\n\nRedskins: I'm not touching this one.\n\nBuccaneers: There are roughly 2,779,276 Buccaneers fans. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buccaneer), the term \"buccaneer\" refers specifically to Caribbean pirates of the 17th and 18th century. They're all dead. There are more Buccaneers fans than buccaneers.\n\nFalcons: There are roughly 6,009,462 Falcons fans. The common kestrel (5,000,000 worldwide) and Merlin (1,300,000 worldwide) alone cover this number, according to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falconiformes_by_population). There are more falcons than Falcons fans.\n\nPanthers: There are roughly 7,034,101 Panthers fans. \"Panther\" is kind of a loosely defined term, but the genus *Panthera* includes tigers (3,890 worldwide), lions (20,000), jaguars (15,000), leopards (250,000), and snow leopards (6,000). That adds up to 294,890. There are more Panthers fans than panthers.\n\nSaints: There are roughly 11,930,352 Saints fans. For this study, I've only been counting living things, and you have to die to become a saint. Not that it really matters, since the Catholic Church has only canonized about 10,000 people anyway. There are more Saints fans than saints.\n\n49ers: There are roughly 12,383,284 49ers fans. \"49ers\" refers to people who partook in the 1849 California gold rush. The oldest living person was born in 1900. All of the 49ers are dead. There are more 49ers fans than 49ers.\n\nCardinals: There are roughly 4,279,156 Cardinals fans. There are about 120,000,000 [northern cardinals alone](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/lifehistory). There are more cardinals than Cardinals fans.\n\nRams: There are roughly 2,327,583 Rams fans. A ram can refer to either a male sheep or a male goat (note to all of the Patriots fans about to make what they think is a super clever comment: just stop). There are over a billion sheep in the world and nearly as many goats. This isn't even close. There are more rams than Rams fans.\n\nSeahawks: There are roughly 11,993,609 Seahawks fans. A seahawk is another name for an osprey, of which there are fewer than 100,000 in the world. There are more Seahawks fans than seahawks.\n\nBengals: There are roughly 3,517,293 Bengals fans. There are 2,500 Bengal tigers left (to be honest I'm just going to stop posting sources when the information is a single search away because I'm already tired of this and I still have half the league to go). There are more Bengals fans than Bengals.\n\nBrowns: There are roughly 3,738,429 Browns fans for some reason. The Browns are named after someone whose last name was Brown. In the United States, there are about [1,552,500 people](http://www.namestatistics.com/lastname/brown) with that last name. The majority of the people who speak English as a first language live in the United States, so it's very likely that the majority of Browns do as well. There are probably more Browns fans than Browns.\n\nRavens: There are roughly 6,927,791 Ravens fans. [There are 20,000,000 common ravens alone.](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/lifehistory). There are more ravens than Ravens fans.\n\nSteelers: There are roughly 19,179,380 Steelers fans. There are only about 87,000 or so steel workers in the United States, and I'm just once again going to extrapolate and say that there aren't several hundred times more than that outside of the USA. There are probably more Steelers fans than steelers.\n\nBills: There are roughly 2,533,838 Bills fans. The Buffalo Bills were named after Buffalo Bill, so it makes sense to use the number of people named Bill. There are about [3,002,475](http://www.namestatistics.com/firstname/male/william) people in the United States named William. Using the same logic as we did with the Browns suggests that there are roughly twice as many Williams in the world as Bills fans, so we'd need at least half of all Williams to go by Bill. Especially considering how many common nicknames for William there are, this seems unlikely. There are probably more Bills fans than Bills.\n\nDolphins: There are roughly 6,637,669 Dolphins fans. I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but we don't really have much of an idea how many dolphins there are in the world (the ocean is, like, really big). My standards for reputable sources have fallen so far at this point in this regrettable project that I'm just going to use [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-many-dolphins-are-there-in-the-world-1), where \"Patricia Barquin, Enthusiast\" believes that there are well over seven million. So there are probably more dolphins than Dolphins fans. Whatever.\n\nJets: There are roughly 5,824,758 Jets fans. Apparently, there are about 20,000 commercial airplanes in the world. A lot of those are not jets, but there are also a bunch of private jets. Either way, there's no way the number of jets is in the millions. There are more Jets fans than jets.\n\nPatriots: There are roughly 20,653,722 Patriots fans. A [Gallup poll from last July](http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx) found that 52% of Americans are proud to be Americans, so there are way more than twenty million people in the U.S. who consider themselves patriots, which is good enough for me. Yeah, we've had an ugly election since then but considering that the president still has an approval rating in the 30s, there's zero chance that the percentage of Americans who are patriots is less than 10%. There are more patriots than Patriots fans.\n\nColts: There are roughly 6,689,254 Colts fans. A [Colt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)) is a male horse under the age of four. There are 58,000,000 horses in the world. The lifespan of a horse in the wild is about 15-20 years (we'll take an average of 17.5 years) and I do not feel like doing in-depth research into the horse industry so I'm just going to assume that the 58,000,000 horses are distributed evenly by sex and age. That would mean 29,000,000 male horses, of which about 6,628,571 would be under the age of four. This is ridiculously close, but using my obviously extremely accurate numbers it looks like there are more Colts fans than colts!\n\nJaguars: There are roughly 1,748,475 Jaguars fans, significantly higher than my initial guess of 87. As I said earlier, there are about 15,000 jaguars in the world. There are more Jaguars fans than jaguars.\n\nTexans: There are roughly 6,484,945 Texans fans. Texas has a population of about 27,470,000. There are more Texans than Texans fans.\n\nTitans: There are roughly 2,737,981 Titans fans. Titans are mythological creatures. There are only 26 of them anyway. There are more Titans fans than Titans.\n\nBroncos: There are roughly 13,082,453 Broncos fans. A bronco is apparently just a name for an untrained horse. The vast majority of the world's 58,000,000 horses are domestic horses, and I'm just going to assume that most of those are trained because I don't know why they wouldn't be and also I am extremely sick of looking all of this stuff up. It would be convenient if Reddit had an option to save drafts of posts but it doesn't appear to. Anyway, the vast majority of horses are not broncos, so that means that there are probably more Broncos fans than broncos.\n\nChargers: There are roughly 4,700,430 Chargers fans. The Los Angeles Chargers [don't seem to have been named after an actual thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers#1960.E2.80.931970:_the_AFL_years), so I'll improvise. I own several chargers. So does everyone I know. Considering how ubiquitous electronic devices are, there have to be billions of chargers. There are more chargers than Chargers fans.\n\nChiefs: There are roughly 4,568,973 Chiefs fans. [Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief) is an honorary title used by a lot or organizations, but do they combine to account for one out of every 2000 people or so in the world? I doubt it. There are probably more Chiefs fans than Chiefs.\n\nRaiders: There are roughly 10,099,869 Raiders fans. Meanwhile, a \"raider\" isn't really an actual thing. It's pretty much only used for sports teams. There are more Raiders fans than raiders, I guess.\n\n**Summary**: So the teams with fewer fans than their namesakes are:\n\nAtlanta Falcons  \nArizona Cardinals  \nLos Angeles Rams  \nBaltimore Ravens  \nMiami Dolphins  \nNew England Patriots  \nHouston Texans  \nLos Angeles Chargers  \n\nMake of that what you will.\n\n**Conclusion**: Turns out that there are a lot of birds in the world.",

For this study, I&#39;ve only been counting living things, and you have to die to become a saint. Not that it really matters, since the Catholic Church has only canonized about 10,000 people anyway. There are more Saints fans than saints.</p>\n\n<p>49ers: There are roughly 12,383,284 49ers fans. &quot;49ers&quot; refers to people who partook in the 1849 California gold rush. The oldest living person was born in 1900. All of the 49ers are dead. There are more 49ers fans than 49ers.</p>\n\n<p>Cardinals: There are roughly 4,279,156 Cardinals fans. There are about 120,000,000 <a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/lifehistory\">northern cardinals alone</a>. There are more cardinals than Cardinals fans.</p>\n\n<p>Rams: There are roughly 2,327,583 Rams fans. A ram can refer to either a male sheep or a male goat (note to all of the Patriots fans about to make what they think is a super clever comment: just stop). There are over a billion sheep in the world and nearly as many goats. This isn&#39;t even close. There are more rams than Rams fans.</p>\n\n<p>Seahawks: There are roughly 11,993,609 Seahawks fans. A seahawk is another name for an osprey, of which there are fewer than 100,000 in the world. There are more Seahawks fans than seahawks.</p>\n\n<p>Bengals: There are roughly 3,517,293 Bengals fans. There are 2,500 Bengal tigers left (to be honest I&#39;m just going to stop posting sources when the information is a single search away because I&#39;m already tired of this and I still have half the league to go). There are more Bengals fans than Bengals.</p>\n\n<p>Browns: There are roughly 3,738,429 Browns fans for some reason. The Browns are named after someone whose last name was Brown. In the United States, there are about <a href=\"http://www.namestatistics.com/lastname/brown\">1,552,500 people</a> with that last name. The majority of the people who speak English as a first language live in the United States, so it&#39;s very likely that the majority of Browns do as well. There are probably more Browns fans than Browns.</p>\n\n<p>Ravens: There are roughly 6,927,791 Ravens fans. <a href=\"https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/lifehistory\">There are 20,000,000 common ravens alone.</a>. There are more ravens than Ravens fans.</p>\n\n<p>Steelers: There are roughly 19,179,380 Steelers fans. There are only about 87,000 or so steel workers in the United States, and I&#39;m just once again going to extrapolate and say that there aren&#39;t several hundred times more than that outside of the USA. There are probably more Steelers fans than steelers.</p>\n\n<p>Bills: There are roughly 2,533,838 Bills fans. The Buffalo Bills were named after Buffalo Bill, so it makes sense to use the number of people named Bill. There are about <a href=\"http://www.namestatistics.com/firstname/male/william\">3,002,475</a> people in the United States named William. Using the same logic as we did with the Browns suggests that there are roughly twice as many Williams in the world as Bills fans, so we&#39;d need at least half of all Williams to go by Bill. Especially considering how many common nicknames for William there are, this seems unlikely. There are probably more Bills fans than Bills.</p>\n\n<p>Dolphins: There are roughly 6,637,669 Dolphins fans. I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but we don&#39;t really have much of an idea how many dolphins there are in the world (the ocean is, like, really big). My standards for reputable sources have fallen so far at this point in this regrettable project that I&#39;m just going to use <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/How-many-dolphins-are-there-in-the-world-1\">Quora</a>, where &quot;Patricia Barquin, Enthusiast&quot; believes that there are well over seven million. So there are probably more dolphins than Dolphins fans. Whatever.</p>\n\n<p>Jets: There are roughly 5,824,758 Jets fans. Apparently, there are about 20,000 commercial airplanes in the world. A lot of those are not jets, but there are also a bunch of private jets. Either way, there&#39;s no way the number of jets is in the millions. There are more Jets fans than jets.</p>\n\n<p>Patriots: There are roughly 20,653,722 Patriots fans. A <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx\">Gallup poll from last July</a> found that 52% of Americans are proud to be Americans, so there are way more than twenty million people in the U.S. who consider themselves patriots, which is good enough for me. Yeah, we&#39;ve had an ugly election since then but considering that the president still has an approval rating in the 30s, there&#39;s zero chance that the percentage of Americans who are patriots is less than 10%. There are more patriots than Patriots fans.</p>\n\n<p>Colts: There are roughly 6,689,254 Colts fans. A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse\">Colt</a>) is a male horse under the age of four. There are 58,000,000 horses in the world. The lifespan of a horse in the wild is about 15-20 years (we&#39;ll take an average of 17.5 years) and I do not feel like doing in-depth research into the horse industry so I&#39;m just going to assume that the 58,000,000 horses are distributed evenly by sex and age. That would mean 29,000,000 male horses, of which about 6,628,571 would be under the age of four. This is ridiculously close, but using my obviously extremely accurate numbers it looks like there are more Colts fans than colts!</p>\n\n<p>Jaguars: There are roughly 1,748,475 Jaguars fans, significantly higher than my initial guess of 87. As I said earlier, there are about 15,000 jaguars in the world. There are more Jaguars fans than jaguars.</p>\n\n<p>Texans: There are roughly 6,484,945 Texans fans. Texas has a population of about 27,470,000. There are more Texans than Texans fans.</p>\n\n<p>Titans: There are roughly 2,737,981 Titans fans. Titans are mythological creatures. There are only 26 of them anyway. There are more Titans fans than Titans.</p>\n\n<p>Broncos: There are roughly 13,082,453 Broncos fans. A bronco is apparently just a name for an untrained horse. The vast majority of the world&#39;s 58,000,000 horses are domestic horses, and I&#39;m just going to assume that most of those are trained because I don&#39;t know why they wouldn&#39;t be and also I am extremely sick of looking all of this stuff up. It would be convenient if Reddit had an option to save drafts of posts but it doesn&#39;t appear to. Anyway, the vast majority of horses are not broncos, so that means that there are probably more Broncos fans than broncos.</p>\n\n<p>Chargers: There are roughly 4,700,430 Chargers fans. The Los Angeles Chargers <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers#1960.E2.80.931970:_the_AFL_years\">don&#39;t seem to have been named after an actual thing</a>, so I&#39;ll improvise. I own several chargers. So does everyone I know. Considering how ubiquitous electronic devices are, there have to be billions of chargers. There are more chargers than Chargers fans.</p>\n\n<p>Chiefs: There are roughly 4,568,973 Chiefs fans. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief\">Chief</a> is an honorary title used by a lot or organizations, but do they combine to account for one out of every 2000 people or so in the world? I doubt it. There are probably more Chiefs fans than Chiefs.</p>\n\n<p>Raiders: There are roughly 10,099,869 Raiders fans. Meanwhile, a &quot;raider&quot; isn&#39;t really an actual thing. It&#39;s pretty much only used for sports teams. There are more Raiders fans than raiders, I guess.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: So the teams with fewer fans than their namesakes are:</p>\n\n<p>Atlanta Falcons<br/>\nArizona Cardinals<br/>\nLos Angeles Rams<br/>\nBaltimore Ravens<br/>\nMiami Dolphins<br/>\nNew England Patriots<br/>\nHouston Texans<br/>\nLos Angeles Chargers  </p>\n\n<p>Make of that what you will.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Turns out that there are a lot of birds in the world.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

        "selftext": "MEMPHIS GRIZZLIES SCOREKEEPER POSTING FRAUDULENT NUMBERS FOR DEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE YEAR LEADER JAREN JACKSON JR. \n\nI would like to bring to your attention the scorekeeper of the Memphis Grizzlies.\u00a0 I was wondering how a solid defensive player can suddenly have some specific statistical categories that are completely off the charts.\u00a0 I am referring to Jaren Jackson Jr., who, after having missed ~16 games to start the season due to off-season foot surgery immediately started having extreme outlier high steals + blocks statistics, leading the entire NBA in blocks per game by a wide margin.\u00a0 In fewer minutes per game than other players Jaron Jackson repeatedly gets outlandish block numbers at home. \n\nI decided to take a closer look at his games and IMMEDIATELY 1 thing became crystal clear.\u00a0 At home in Memphis he has 66 blocks in 16 home games, averaging 4.13 blocks per game, versus just 35 in 16 road games, averaging 2.19 in nearly identical minutes- an 89% increase in Memphis.\u00a0 In home games he has been credited with 22 steals in 16 home games, versus only 10 steals in 16 road games.\u00a0 This means he is averaging nearly 1.4 steals per game at home, but just 0.63 steals on the road per game- an astounding 120% increase in Memphis.\u00a0 In home games he has been credited with 88 blocks + steals, versus 45 on the road.\u00a0 This equates to an average of an outlandish 5.5 blocks+steals at home in limited minutes versus a reasonable and realistic, and still outstanding, 2.81 steals+blocks per game on the road.\u00a0 This equates to a 1.96X home stat increase only in these 2 categories.\u00a0 A 96% increase in performance specifically at home is truly an aberration which should be reviewed.\u00a0 This demonstrates the sort of incredulous statistics which calls for serious analysis. \n\nJust 3 out of his 14 games this season with 5+ blocks+steals have come on the road.\u00a0 8 out of 9 of his 6+ steals+blocks games have been recorded in Memphis.\u00a0 I decided to watch 2 memphis grizzlies games where he had one of his ludicrous 8+ blocks+steals games.\u00a0 By my count he actually had 3 fewer \"stocks\"(some people refer to steals+blocks as stocks) than he was credited for by the home scorekeeper.\u00a0 I wonder if the scorekeeper has some sort of vested interest in Jaren Jackson getting maximum high value defensive statistics that he thinks he can get away with putting down into the box score.\u00a0 \n\nJaren Jackson in July - mid November started as high as +10,000 for DPOY at certain sportsbooks after the Grizzlies announced he had undergone a procedure to address a stress fracture in his right foot and would be sidelined for 4-6 months.\u00a0 Now, in large part thanks to these blatantly wrong statistics, he is a huge odds on favorite at higher than -200. \n\nI conducted some analysis on all 78 games jaren jackson played last season... my hypothesis was that his home/road difference on steals & blocks would both be small.\u00a0 He had 90 blocks in Memphis and 87 blocks on the road.\u00a0 He had 39 steals in Memphis and 34 steals on the road.\u00a0 He had 129 \"stocks\" in Memphis vs. 121 \"stocks\" on the road.\u00a0 BPG was actually 12.7% lower on the road(he played 4 fewer home games) while steals+blocks/game was 15% lower on the road- higher than i expected, but reasonable given all the differences for Memphis when playing at home vs on the road, from their home/away record difference to crowd noise to effort/energy/intensity exerted by players, etc.\n90%+ higher in Memphis, however, as is the case this season, is NOT REASONABLE AND COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC.\u00a0 My educated guess is that the Memphis scorekeeper(s) have been changed since last season and/or ULTERIOR MOTIVES, INCENTIVES are now in play with respect to JJJ's defensive statistics. \n\nWhy is this happening so blatantly to the point where a person can just look at Jaren Jackson Jrs. steals+blocks #s on the box score and determine with a high level of confidence whether that game was played on the road or in Memphis is the next question... \n\nThree potential explanations, only one of which is innocent: \n\n1. Jaren Jackson plays MUCH MUCH MUCH harder at home and hustles like a maniac and focuses on stealing and blocking shots like crazy in Memphis, causing his numbers to be skewed in an absurd manner even compared to his regular highly efficient top 3- but realistic, road numbers. This can almost certainly be discounted because i looked at his other statistics and everything from his minutes per game to points per game to rebounds per game and even fouls are close in terms of home/away splits. \n\n2. The Memphis scorekeeper is a huge Jaren Jackson Jr. fan and is purposely imbellishing his steals & blocks, since that is much easier to do than points or rebounds, for instance.\u00a0 When he contests a shot well, but does not touch the ball, perhaps the scorekeeper purposely gives him the undeserved stat and donates blocks to him where none occurred, for instance. \n\n3. It should also be investigated in this age of fantasy basketball and gambling on sports whether this scorekeeper and/or his family and friends bet on Jaren Jackson to win the defensive player of the year award at super long odds and as a result has a tremendous financial incentive to juice and fake a player's 2 most valuable defensive statistics- BLOCKS and STEALS, which are also the easiest to fudge #s on because it is often most difficult to definitively label steals and blocks without slow motion on at least some of the plays in question. \n\nI and all NBA fans would appreciate a thorough investigation into this matter.\u00a0 It is important to have 100% integrity in statistics not only for things such as fantasy sports, sportsbetting, futures wagers, but even more importantly to ENSURE THE INTEGRITY OF THE GAME FOR ALL.\u00a0 This is mandatory to be able to compare players' statistics versus other players now in the league fairly as well as across seasons and know the numbers are accurate, correct, and not unfairly manipulated by home arena scorekeepers. \n\nI decided to watch just a few of the Grizzlies' recent games and immediately started noticing a pattern: Plays at FedEx arena in Memphis constantly being scored wrongly to gift Jackson extra steals and blocks which never occurred.\u00a0 Simply put, if a shot does not hit the rim or it otherwise looks bad somehow, and Jaren Jackson is either contesting the shot or close to the action, he is credited with FRAUDULENT blocks repeatedly.\u00a0 Sometimes this is achieved by taking away the stat from his teammates. Other times, an opposing player simply loses the ball or shoots a contested shot way off target, but Jackson nevertheless is credited with steals & blocks that never occurred in both instances.\u00a0 Also, when he deflects a ball and it goes to a teammate he is credited with the steal.\u00a0 When his teammate deflects the ball and it goes to him he is STILL credited with the steal IN MEMPHIS.\u00a0 When he tips or deflects a ball, but never gains possession nor do the Grizzlies, he is still awarded a steal. \n\nThe following is just a very small % of questionable or outright WRONG steals and blocks given to Jackson: \n\nExample #1 New Orleans Pelicans @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSaturday 12/31\n7mins, 21 sec remaining in the 2nd quarter\nZion drives to the basket, NEVER shoots the ball, and loses it. \"Williamson in a crowd, ball pops free, picked up by Tyus Jones, turnover number 9 by the pelicans\" announcers say.\u00a0 Scorekeeper in Memphis graded the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. blocks Zion Williamson's 3-foot driving layup \n\nExample #2 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies \nSunday 1/8 \n10:09 remaining in the 1st quarter\nJordan Clarkson throws a bad pass directly to Desmond Bane and Jaren Jackson for some odd reason is credited with the steal.\u00a0 Bane actually steals the ball. \n\nExample #3 Utah Jazz @ Memphis Grizzlies\nSunday 1/8\n1:46 remaining in the 4th quarter\nKelly Olynyk loses the ball while being defended by Xavier Tillman.\u00a0 The ball then bounces off Tillman and Jaren Jackson before being picked up by Tillman. The steal should be credited to Tillman.\u00a0 Memphis scorekeeper grades the play as Jaren Jackson Jr. steals \n\nExample #4 Phoenix Suns @ Memphis Grizzlies\nMonday 1/16\n7:02 remaining in the 4th quarter\nBrandon Clarke blocks Saban Lee's layup, but the Memphis scorekeeper instantly gives the block to nearby Jaren Jackson Jr. \n\nExample #5 Cleveland Cavaliers @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday 1/18\n11:48 remaining in the 2nd quarter\nLamar Stevens, who Jaren Jackson helps on, loses the ball and Desmond Bane picks it up and gains possession.\u00a0 The Memphis scorekeeper gave steal to Jaren Jackson. \n\nExample #6 Detroit Pistons @ Memphis Grizzlies\nFriday, December 9th\n39 seconds remaining in the 2nd quarter\nJackson deflects a pass and never gains possession, saved back to Detroit player. Memphis scorekeeper gives a steal to Jackson. \n\nExample #7 Oklahoma City Thunder @ Memphis Grizzlies\nWednesday, December 7th\n10:38 4th quarter\nJackson saves out of bounds ball directly to Thunder player underneath basket for quick score, but gets credited with a steal. \n\nThank you very much for reading this.\u00a0 I would appreciate well thought out responses, a good discussion, and also advice on how someone in charge at the NBA can investigate these plays as well as others from Grizzlies games, and the dishonest Memphis scorekeeper.\u00a0 Also, can obviously fraudulent statistics be deleted, corrected & reversed weeks/months later?",

A whopping 17+ dps would amount to a 60% damage increase for me.  Could I do it?\n\nAbsolutely and unequivocally not.  I died multiple times to the level 23 mobs before throwing in the towel and dodging quillboar to mine for tin in the area.\n\nA level 24 priest appears and is melting mobs.  I humbly ask if I can tag along and he agrees.  I laid hamstring on the mobs to keep them under control and leached the juicy exp, hoping for the three quest drops necessary to complete my quest (absolute garbage drop rate).\n\nHe killed his quest mob after 5 minutes but decided to help me out while he grinded to 25.  Greens were dropping like mad and despite my protests he left them for me to pick up on FFA loot.  \"It's all you, man.\"\n\n30 minutes later he dings and I still need 1 more drop.  It's taking forever and I say goodbye - but no, he wants to finish the deed.  What a nice guy.\n\nAnother 20 minutes and we finally finish up.  I thank him profusely, offering my help in the future but knowing itll take me another month to hit 25.  I'll never be able to repay him.\n\nWe part ways as I mine the last couple of veins and he starts back up the Gold Road.  He's still in my group and all of a sudden I see his health bar plummet to 20% and a hamstring/rend appears on his portrait.  He is flagged for PvP, and a warrior had him in his clutches.\n\nI dart toward the road as fast as I can.  I arrive on the scene and the human warrior had been feared by a psychic scream.  /rude emotes were flying from my compatriot as he turned tail to run.  But it was useless.  The warrior began mounting up to chase him down.  It was only a matter of seconds before my new friend would be laying on the ground.\n\nI am running toward the warrior, dodging hyenas and just hoping I can do *something*.  I tell him to run for his life, and whatever happens just dont stop - I'm a willing sacrifice.\n\nThe warrior's mount animation completes and an epic armored warhorse appears.  I am desperately mashing my charge in the hope that I can at least distract him for a moment.\n\nI dash forward as soon as the button lights up and to my surprise the charge stun wasn't resisted.  Amazing.  It gives me the split second I need to pop blood rage and mash hamstring.  Fat chance, I thought.   But the first one lands and he has no choice but to dismount and turn his fury toward me.\n\nHe lays a huge hit on me as I spam the customary emotes and shuffle around him, waiting to die as I laugh and scream in complete hysterics at my computer screen.  But just then I realize - while he is hamstrung I am free to run.\n\nIm at 42 hp and I take off in the other direction.  He swaps to berserker stance to put the nail in the coffin - but the second I see the icon I run back in his direction.  I'm in the sweet spot.  7 yards out.  Too far to swing at me, and too close to land a charge.\n\nI run and strafe forward and backward as he tries to catch me, and I can see it - he is completely lost. \n\nThe panic sets in, and then the rage builds.  He swaps from berserker back to battle, then back to berserker.  Five stance changes later and the hamstring wears off - he catches me with the final hit.  I am slain.\n\nBy now, my new friend was halfway to camp Taurajo and managed to duck onto a side path, completely shocked and feverishly asking me what in the holy hell happened.\n\nHe is safe, and though my lifeless body sits blood- soaked in the dust beneath the harsh southward eye of the Barrens sun...I am victorious.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit:  some people from Smolderweb whispered and gave me his name - Wonsamdi, troll priest.

It was a messy run. My healpartner was a Priest. I farm Karazhan because I really want Lights Justice ([https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=28771/lights-justice](https://tbc.wowhead.com/item=28771/lights-justice)) which is BiS for most healers. I was so happy it dropped, when the priest healer in voice told me that I wont get this item because it is reserved for him. I couldn\u00b4t believe what I heard, following by a big discussion that the raidlead **never told anyone that anything is locked** and therefore I have the right to roll on it. **The raidlead told me at that time he did not saved it for him personally**, they just talked about it but he didnt secured it to him - in the LFG channel it was advertised as a free MS > OS run and in the raid no one told me anything. **After a wild discussion we decided to roll on the item and I won - he rolled 22 and I did roll 78.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[Link. https:\\/\\/imgur.com\\/a\\/ARPCZpD ](https://preview.redd.it/8ihhmcn9js771.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=023281c5bb1c0b21b3c77e4a7038bf4f66555515)\n\n**I rolled 78, the other healer 22.

I dont have that time for goldfarming, but also wanted to enchant it with 81 heal so I lend myself about 500g to enchant it. I was playing arena and everything was good. After a time the player insulted me heavily, I told him that I have no contact to the raidlead and dont know him, I was not told that anything is saved and that we (in the end) decided to roll and I won it fairly. Nothing wrong Ive done here, he just kept insulting me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# 26.06.2021\n\nI played some BGs and noticed I was healing nothing compared to 1-2 days before. **Then I saw that my Justices Light was removed.**\n\nI wrote a ticket about it.

I immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. I had a notification that showed that [AT&T had \"upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge\"](https://imgur.com/LrUUetX)\n\nObviously I was annoyed by this, so I dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. I then found this alert showing that the \"promotional discount\" for this so-called [\"customer loyalty speed upgrade\"](https://imgur.com/PtYazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. \n\nI then looked at my bill and found that they had [upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent](https://imgur.com/ThJwB7J), under the guise of \"customer loyalty\", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most ISPs occasionally do. \n\nI immediately called and spoke to a rep named Jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that AT&T was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. I don't for one second believe this was accidental. I believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.\n\nMake sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. I'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and I don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but I do feel like AT&T should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so I wanted to post to show everyone what happened. If this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. This was just the closest thing I could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.\n\n**Edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login, the 2015 date is inaccurate. I usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so I could make the post easier w/ images etc. Not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as I'm pretty sure I didn't even have AT&T then lol ... anyway, [here's the email I received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing](https://i.imgur.com/I7W1VpU.png)\n\n**Edit 2:** Since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what I did: You should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that I got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). Then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. As others have noted in the comments ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BILL CLOSELY!\n\n**Edit 3:** Fixed some formatting stuff\n\n**Edit 4:** Holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! Thanks anonymous Reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!\n\n**One last edit:** from a PM I received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but I thought this was great info: \n\n>I work in big telcom. What you experienced is called a \u201cslam sale\u201d in the industry. It\u2019s when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. The salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. \n\n>Oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. It was popular until 10 years ago, and it\u2019s almost unheard of today. I wasn\u2019t aware that AT&T was experiencing Slam Sales today. \n\n>You can protect your account from Slam Sales. All the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. Call AT&T, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. You can setup either a password or a PIN that must be entered to make any account changes. \n\n>Sorry this happened to you.\n\nAnd another PM:\n\n>I also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account PIN/Password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. Pretty much every ISP and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80's that's a glorified AS400 mainframe running with a 90's era gui overlay.

I usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so I could make the post easier w/ images etc. Not sure why it&#39;s showing 2015 as my last login as I&#39;m pretty sure I didn&#39;t even have AT&amp;T then lol ... anyway, <a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/I7W1VpU.png\">here&#39;s the email I received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> Since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here&#39;s what I did: You should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn&#39;t get paid (note that I got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). Then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month&#39;s bill manually, then let autopay resume. As others have noted in the comments ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BILL CLOSELY!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 3:</strong> Fixed some formatting stuff</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit 4:</strong> Holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! Thanks anonymous Reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!</p>\n\n<p><strong>One last edit:</strong> from a PM I received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but I thought this was great info: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I work in big telcom. What you experienced is called a \u201cslam sale\u201d in the industry. It\u2019s when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. The salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. </p>\n\n<p>Oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. It was popular until 10 years ago, and it\u2019s almost unheard of today. I wasn\u2019t aware that AT&amp;T was experiencing Slam Sales today. </p>\n\n<p>You can protect your account from Slam Sales. All the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. Call AT&amp;T, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. You can setup either a password or a PIN that must be entered to make any account changes. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry this happened to you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And another PM:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account PIN/Password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. Pretty much every ISP and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80&#39;s that&#39;s a glorified AS400 mainframe running with a 90&#39;s era gui overlay. Scroll about halfway down in <a href=\"http://www.makotek.net/intranet/Forms/ICOMS%20Technician%20Guide.pdf\">this</a> pdf for some screenshots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

        "selftext": "Hey guys! last year I made a spreadsheet to help myself budget- I'm terrible at sticking to a budget so I made a sheet that breaks it down so that I just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount.\n\n[Heres what it looks like](https://imgur.com/a/ojaju7a)\n\nI grew up very poor and had NO sense of what or even HOW to start budgeting. I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. Another problem I faced is that I have ADHD, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe sheet was set up with three goals in mind:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. that it be easy to use\n2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support\n3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nThe main budget is divided into three core areas:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Income: You use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly pay cycle. If you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips, my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- So for example, if you usually make 100 from tips a week, even if you get extra, try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.\n* Expenses:  There you can add your expenses. Utilities are bills that are for electricity, heat, phone, internet, or water. Bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. Finally, expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas, lunch expenses, transportation- ect. Within your expenses there are TWO areas to which you need to pay attention:-Credit Card Payments: this is new to this year's sheet, use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. Decide whether to pay the minimum payment OR choose an amount to pay. The tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  Once you have filled it out, your budget will adjust accordingly.-Big Purchase: Use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase, and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!\n* Budget summary:  Finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- Here you will see just how much you can spend. This money is shown in three ways, the lump monthly sum, a weekly amount, or a daily amount. As long as you don't go over that number, you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. It will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it, where your money is going, and what your income VS spending is!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[~~Here is a link to the sheet~~](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCjtrGVKUM7siXilSaqnlHXwemH-QGBEULZBm5bEDMg/copy)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nou use it like this\n\n* Go in\n* Make a copy\n* Change the numbers\n* Decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved\n* Budget.\n\nThe sheet includes three charts:\n\n* A bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving\n* A pie chart to see where your money is distributed\n* A daily Pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings\n\nI don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n^(NOTE: All Images in the spreadsheet are from vecteezy)\n\nEDIT:\n\n# [NEW COPY LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jm0-n4TP98Vb5FkYKAZIqYOxO1rE9DJV7dWo_zFO31E/copy)",

        "selftext": "**Holy shit at the money people spend on food!**\n\nAnd I was the exact same way when I landed my first job out of college.  You know what I'm talking about--biscuit and Starbucks on the way to work, lunch out with coworkers and pizza and beer at the local tavern for dinner!  Every night!  All week!  Professional money spender!  And more beers and dinners on the weekends!  Woohoo!\n\nWait.  Where did all my money go?  And how the hell did I gain 40 pounds in six months?  If you're nodding your head you've fallen into the brand-new-job-big-salary-eat-out-because-I-can trap.  And you have to stop it.  It's killing your bank account, it's killing your financial freedom and it's killing *you*. (Literally--I was on the edge of type 2 diabetes and had hyperglycemia during routine physicals.)\n\n**What you know you need to do: *STOP EATING OUT***\n\nBut how??? How do I stop eating out???  Fast food is *soooo* good!  And cooking is *soooo* hard!  Well, first off, not really--you're just attuned to that garbage 'food'.  You're going to break free of both these stereotypes and someone has already invented it.....\n\n>Crockpot.  It's the crockpot.  Crockpot.  Crockpot.  Maybe you call it a slow cooker, but I'm from Georgia and here it's a crockpot.  \n\n***!STOP!***--If you do not own a crockpot I highly recommend you go buy one from Amazon and buy the biggest one you can afford!\n\nGet one with a timer that switches to warm after the cook settings: *JUST GOOGLE IT CAUSE MODS DONT LIKE LINKS!*\n\n**BOOM!**  $39 investment.  We're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  Are you ready?  We're going to make enough food for dinner *AND* left overs for lunch.\n\nI'm going to give you some of my super-secret-I-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious, cheap, filling and easy.  Yes.  The crockpot makes *all* of those possible.\n\n**MEAL 1: Thick Cut Porkchop with Potatoes and Carrots**\n\n>Servings: 4\n\n>Ingredients:\n\n>1 Can Beef Broth (50 cents)\n\n>1 Packet Brown Gravy Mix (50 cents)\n\n>1 Packet Onion Soup Mix (50 cents)\n\n>1 Package of 4 Thick Cut Porkchops ($7)\n\n>6 Carrots (50 cents)\n\n>4 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)\n\n>Sack o' Salad ($2)\n\n>Total cost for lunch and dinner: $13/4 about $3 each.\n\n>Spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  Add beef broth, gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  Place porkchops in broth.  Chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  That's it.\n\n>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home make your salad and dig in.  Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.\n\n**MEAL 2: Sausage, Potato and Kale Soup**\n>Servings: 4\n\n>1 Pound Italian Sausage ($4)\n\n>1 White Onion ($1)\n\n>1 32 Oz Box of Chicken Stock ($1.50)\n\n>1 Bag of Prewashed Kale ($3)\n\n>3/4 Cup Heavy Cream ($1)\n\n>5 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)\n\n>1 Head of Garlic ($1)\n\n>Total cost: About $14/4 = 3.50 a serving\n\n>Brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  While meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream, chicken stock, and chopped yukon potatoes.  Add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (I get two recipes per bag of kale).\n\n>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.\n\n**MEAL 3: Super Awesome Easy Chili**\n>Servings: A Lot (6-8?) -- I eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  Stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)\n\n>3 Cans of Black Beans ($2)\n\n>2 Cans of Hot Chili Beans ($1)\n\n>2 Cans of Red Kidney Beans ($1)\n\n>8 Cans of Diced Tomatoes ($6)\n\n>1 Pound of Ground Beef ($4)\n\n>1/2 Cup of Chili Powder ($1)\n\n>1/4 Cup of Garlic Powder ($1)\n\n>1/4 Cup of Onion Powder ($1)\n\n>3 Tablespoons of Cumin ($1)\n\n>3 Tablespoons Black Pepper ($1)\n\n>Edit: The spice proportions are correct!  This makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7L).\n\n>Edit: Salt to Taste($1)\n\n>Total cost = $20/8 = About $2.50 per serving\n\n>Drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.

I genuinely cared about my job and the account, so I waited to accept a job offer until I had trained someone else to do my job.

When I told him that I had accepted a position with another company in our field but would not be doing the same thing so it wouldn\u2019t violate my non-compete, he called our chief legal office on speaker phone while I sat there. The CLO tells me that \u201cI cannot even mop floors at a company in our field for at least a year\u201d. The CLO adds HR to the call and HR tells me that since I won\u2019t be pursuing my new job, they are going to let me work 2 more weeks to make sure the handoff goes smoothly and then I will be fired for looking for other jobs. \n\nThey asked me for more details as to what I would be doing at my new job, and I told them I wasn\u2019t going to discuss it. After I left, the CLO of this company (a company who brings in $6 BILLION/year in revenue) called me randomly for the next few weeks trying to intimidate me. They even started contacting my new employer. Luckily, I don\u2019t work for a shitty company now and the CEO got involved and told them that they would be ready to fight this in court. They stopped contacting me after that, which meant they never even planed in taking me to court. They just wanted to scare me into quitting my new job. \n\nFuck companies like this.

        "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>I worked my ass off for this man, essentially running his entire book of business for him. For Christmas he got me a $25 AMC gift card. The closest AMC theater is 1.5hrs away in another state. That pissed me off and made me start looking for other jobs. I genuinely cared about my job and the account, so I waited to accept a job offer until I had trained someone else to do my job. When the time came, I met him in his office and told him that I had accepted another job and that I was putting in my notice, but to not worry because I have someone already trained. When I told him that I had accepted a position with another company in our field but would not be doing the same thing so it wouldn\u2019t violate my non-compete, he called our chief legal office on speaker phone while I sat there. The CLO tells me that \u201cI cannot even mop floors at a company in our field for at least a year\u201d. The CLO adds HR to the call and HR tells me that since I won\u2019t be pursuing my new job, they are going to let me work 2 more weeks to make sure the handoff goes smoothly and then I will be fired for looking for other jobs. </p>\n\n<p>They asked me for more details as to what I would be doing at my new job, and I told them I wasn\u2019t going to discuss it. After I left, the CLO of this company (a company who brings in $6 BILLION/year in revenue) called me randomly for the next few weeks trying to intimidate me. They even started contacting my new employer. Luckily, I don\u2019t work for a shitty company now and the CEO got involved and told them that they would be ready to fight this in court. They stopped contacting me after that, which meant they never even planed in taking me to court. They just wanted to scare me into quitting my new job. </p>\n\n<p>Fuck companies like this. We don\u2019t have to put up with this shit anymore</p>\n\n<p>Company is Total Quality Logistics.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: this was 3 years ago. I\u2019m with the same company that I left my previous job for, and they have given me the budget to start a division of the company that directly competes with my previous employer \ud83e\udd17 I still have that AMC gift card too.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll go ahead and address some of the questions I keep getting asked:</p>\n\n<p>Why did you stay if you were so underpaid for your performance? Because I was fresh out of college and dumb. </p>\n\n<p>Why did you tell them where you were going? Because I was fresh out of college and dumb. </p>\n\n<p>Why did you even give them a two week notice, why didnt you walk out? Because the people who I actually cared about at that job would be the ones who felt the effects of that more than my manager.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

        "selftext": "Dear Blizzard Entertainment,\n\n\u200b\n\nGameplay first.\n\n\u200b\n\nThose are your words. Your founding words. And you have abandoned them.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm a grumpy 41-year old male. I'm cynical and skeptical. I work in marketing, and I hate the business. It's full of bollocks and bullshit. At the core of all that is the ridiculous idea that customers want to engage with companies and have conversations and relationships and other such nonsense. I don't care a thing for the companies whose products I buy. I don't want a relationship with Coke. I don't visit fan forums for Tide. And I will never pay any amount of money to watch or attend a Levi's convention. I just want good products, at reasonable prices.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'm not a fan of corporations the way that I'm a fan of the Denver Broncos. I don't yell at the TV when I see a stupid McDonald's commercial like I do when Case Keenum throws another interception. I'm not emotionally invested in Nike or Google. I don't want whoever runs those companies to be fired when things go poorly the same way I think Vance Joseph should be fired from the Broncos.\n\n\u200b\n\nAnd why is that? Because I'm emotionally attached to the Broncos. I love that team. I cried when they won Superbowl 50. It's irrational, I know. The win-loss record of a sports team has no effect on my personal life. And yet... I cheer and jeer.\n\n\u200b\n\nThankfully, I don't invest myself into commodity corporations the same way.\n\n\u200b\n\nExcept, that I do.\n\n\u200b\n\nFor more than 20 years Blizzard, you have made games that I love to play. Even the games I was terrible at, I still played. I knew they'd be the best that that genre had to offer. I wasn't any good at the Starcraft games. But I played them anyway. I could only just scrape through the story campaigns in the Warcraft series. But I played it anyway. I loved Diablo, but never played in Hardcore mode or pushed high-level rifts. Why did I play those games? Because they were fun. I also made some good friends along the way - friends that I still play Blizzard games with. But I didn't truly love Blizzard until 2004, when I first stepped foot into Dun Morogh.\n\n\u200b\n\nI'll never forget traipsing through the snow and climbing the hill to see Ironforge for the first time. I've loved World of Warcraft (and you, Blizzard) ever since.\n\n\u200b\n\nA canvas poster of the original World of Warcraft box hangs on my wall. A little figure of Arthas guards my desk. In my closet, Blizzard branded t-shirts hang next to my Broncos gear. I'm not just a guy who buys Blizzard's products like I buy other stuff. I'm a Blizzard fan. I pay to watch BlizzCon. I root for the company to succeed like I do the Broncos. But now, when I see that poster or wear one of my Blizzard shirts, I feel a bit like I do when I watch a Broncos game. I'm cheering for a team that used to be great but just isn't anymore. I keep watching though, because that's what loyal fans do. And I keep hoping for better days.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the Blizzard Retrospective documentary published in 2011, Bob Davidson said: \"it wasn't hard to let Blizzard do it's thing... as long as it was working.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nBlizzard, the things you are doing now are not working.\n\n\u200b\n\nMaybe you know this. Maybe it's causing internal power struggles at the office. And maybe you are too deep to see that you are no longer the company that prided itself on \"gameplay first.\" The only reason Blizzard gamers exist at all is because of great gameplay. But great gameplay is hard. It takes years of testing and iteration to get right. And it's expensive. You were always known for taking your sweet development time. \"Soon,\" we were told. \"It'll be done soon.\" And we knew that you were creating something beautiful and amazing that was, despite any flaws that might exist, going to be fun. \"Soon\" was almost always worth the wait. But you don't make those kinds of games anymore. And I wonder if you ever will again.\n\n\u200b\n\nDo you know why I logged onto World of Warcraft day after day those first few years? It wasn't because 15-minute corpse runs were fun. It wasn't so I could wait for the warlock to farm soul shards or for the hunter to travel all the way back to a village to buy arrows before we could finally spend the next 5 hours being lost in Dire Maul. It wasn't to craft copper bars or gather runecloth so I could buy a cross-racial mount. Though, I did all of those things, and many, many more.\n\n\u200b\n\nI wasn't logging on to earn or buy loot boxes. I didn't finish a dungeon and hope that whatever the final boss dropped would not only be the thing I wanted, but also titanforge into a super-powered version of the thing I wanted. I didn't log on so I could fill a bar - though there were plenty of bars to fill. I didn't play so I could gather some random source of power that would inevitably fade into irrelevance as soon as some goblin miner discovered a new random source of power. I didn't show up to race through dungeons or to replace pieces of gear every other day with gear that was marginally better (or worse) than what I was wearing.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn fact, I think I wore the same robe for 2 years during classic WoW. I only replaced it after The Burning Crusade released. I didn't log on just so I could tab-out to third-party websites because they were the only way to find out if I had the right talents, the right gear, or to simulate numbers with the gear I did have. I didn't pay $15 a month to earn a score from a third-party so I could participate in the game with other people who valued my random score over my experience playing the game.\n\n\u200b\n\nI played World of Warcraft because just being in Azeroth with a few friends was good enough. I wasn't worried about leveling up quickly so I could \"play the real game\" like people are today. If I set out to do some quests, but got distracted by PvP (corpse runs) or a dungeon (corpse runs), or exploring a zone that was full of monsters just a bit too powerful for my level (more corpse runs), then that was all right. Because exploring Azeroth - an enormous world full of amazing creatures and hidden things - was a lot of fun.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou're deluding yourself if you think that classic World of Warcraft will bring that all back. It won't. It can't. That experience can't be replicated any more than returning to Disneyland as an adult can recreate the first time I visited when I was 10 years old. Those days, and that game are gone. The game that we play today is not a game at all. Instead, World of Warcraft is a data-gathering index of daily user actions and patterns. It's a research tool to help scummy marketing people decide what to put on sale, how much to charge for a fox mount, or which adverts to fill the game launcher with. You no longer see me as a player, but instead, as a payer.\n\n\u200b\n\nNew features in WoW are gated behind reputation bars, time, or just not in the game at all yet. Zandalari trolls were among the first features of Battle for Azeroth that were introduced to us. Zandalari trolls aren't in the game. But they will be... \"soon\". You've tried to hide that exclusion behind storytelling, but it's a thin mask. Patch 8.1 launched on December 11th. The Battle for Dazar'alor (a cumbersome name) won't launch until January 22nd - conveniently just a little bit more than 30 days after someone who might have re-upped for 8.1 started paying for your game again.\n\n\u200b\n\nArguably, there is more stuff to do in WoW than ever before, and yet I don't log on as often as I used to. And worse yet, I don't look forward to playing like I used to. Mostly, I log on to see if any of my friends are playing and that if maybe, just maybe, we can get a few of us together to go earn a loot box or race through a dungeon and pretend that we are having fun again.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou stopped making an MMORPG years ago. Instead, you turned WoW into an elaborate fantasy-themed casino replicator. It's a third-person looter-shooter designed to string players out like addicts looking for a fix. Your other titles are just animated shopping carts that feature mini-games people can play in between opening loot boxes.\n\n\u200b\n\nAnd that's really sad because all of Blizzard's games are beautiful. Your artists are still the best in the industry. It's a shame that their work is being ruined by shady business practices and shoddy gameplay design.\n\n\u200b\n\nWhy is Ion Hazzikostas still the World of Warcraft game director? He bumbles through Q&As saying words but nothing else. Under his (and J. Allen Brack's) direction, the game has become progressively worse. Ion's sidekick, Josh \"Lore\" Allen - the man you hired to be the public face of World of Warcraft - called us \"dickbags\" and is far more interested in building his personal brand than he is in doing the job you pay him to do.\n\n\u200b\n\nI can't tell if these men are being held hostage by a company that has broken their spirits, or if they are burned out, or if they have true contempt for both WoW and its players. Are the creative, passionate people that you are so well known for allowed to work on the design direction of World of Warcraft? Or is the game being designed by algorithms and data-driven stat-padding horseshit? People can tell if something is fun. Computers can't.\n\n\u200b\n\nWe are not your enemy Blizzard. We are your loyal supporters. The luke-warm, fair-weather fans are gone and they are not coming back. We are all you have left. And frankly, when it comes to MMORPGs, you are all we have. Please stop ruining World of Warcraft. Please stop designing it around KPIs, MAUs, and other marketing bullshit. I'll play the game if it's fun. And right now, it's not fun. The people designing and developing the game look tired. Maybe it's time for them to \"move to other unannounced projects\". Or maybe you just need to let them remember what \"gameplay first\" means.\n\n\u200b\n\nI don't know what's happening at Blizzard. I don't know if Activision is flexing its management muscles. I don't know why Mike Morhaime left. I don't know if company morale is low. I don't know why you think it's a good idea to put talented developers to work on mobile projects - games that your audience doesn't bother playing because we are middle-aged adults who, just like your founders, were raised on PC games. I don't know anything about the inner workings of this company that I have supported for almost half of my life.\n\n\u200b\n\nBut I do know Blizzard games. And I know that whatever it is you are producing recently, are not Blizzard games.\n\n\u200b\n\nI hope that whatever it is that is wrong with you, Blizzard, can be fixed. And fixed \"soon.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nFor Azeroth,\n\n\u200b\n\nLightcap, the Patient\n\nIllidan - US",
        "title": "A Letter to Blizzard Entertainment",
        "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Dear Blizzard Entertainment,</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>Gameplay first.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>Those are your words. Your founding words. And you have abandoned them.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m a grumpy 41-year old male. I&#39;m cynical and skeptical. I work in marketing, and I hate the business. It&#39;s full of bollocks and bullshit. At the core of all that is the ridiculous idea that customers want to engage with companies and have conversations and relationships and other such nonsense. I don&#39;t care a thing for the companies whose products I buy. I don&#39;t want a relationship with Coke. I don&#39;t visit fan forums for Tide. And I will never pay any amount of money to watch or attend a Levi&#39;s convention. I just want good products, at reasonable prices.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;m not a fan of corporations the way that I&#39;m a fan of the Denver Broncos. I don&#39;t yell at the TV when I see a stupid McDonald&#39;s commercial like I do when Case Keenum throws another interception. I&#39;m not emotionally invested in Nike or Google. I don&#39;t want whoever runs those companies to be fired when things go poorly the same way I think Vance Joseph should be fired from the Broncos.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>And why is that? Because I&#39;m emotionally attached to the Broncos. I love that team. I cried when they won Superbowl 50. It&#39;s irrational, I know. The win-loss record of a sports team has no effect on my personal life. And yet... I cheer and jeer.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>Thankfully, I don&#39;t invest myself into commodity corporations the same way.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>Except, that I do.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>For more than 20 years Blizzard, you have made games that I love to play. Even the games I was terrible at, I still played. I knew they&#39;d be the best that that genre had to offer. I wasn&#39;t any good at the Starcraft games. But I played them anyway. I could only just scrape through the story campaigns in the Warcraft series. But I played it anyway. I loved Diablo, but never played in Hardcore mode or pushed high-level rifts. Why did I play those games? Because they were fun. I also made some good friends along the way - friends that I still play Blizzard games with. But I didn&#39;t truly love Blizzard until 2004, when I first stepped foot into Dun Morogh.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>I&#39;ll never forget traipsing through the snow and climbing the hill to see Ironforge for the first time. I&#39;ve loved World of Warcraft (and you, Blizzard) ever since.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>A canvas poster of the original World of Warcraft box hangs on my wall. A little figure of Arthas guards my desk. In my closet, Blizzard branded t-shirts hang next to my Broncos gear. I&#39;m not just a guy who buys Blizzard&#39;s products like I buy other stuff. I&#39;m a Blizzard fan. I pay to watch BlizzCon. I root for the company to succeed like I do the Broncos. But now, when I see that poster or wear one of my Blizzard shirts, I feel a bit like I do when I watch a Broncos game. I&#39;m cheering for a team that used to be great but just isn&#39;t anymore. I keep watching though, because that&#39;s what loyal fans do. And I keep hoping for better days.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>In the Blizzard Retrospective documentary published in 2011, Bob Davidson said: &quot;it wasn&#39;t hard to let Blizzard do it&#39;s thing... as long as it was working.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>Blizzard, the things you are doing now are not working.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>Maybe you know this. Maybe it&#39;s causing internal power struggles at the office. And maybe you are too deep to see that you are no longer the company that prided itself on &quot;gameplay first.&quot; The only reason Blizzard gamers exist at all is because of great gameplay. But great gameplay is hard. It takes years of testing and iteration to get right. And it&#39;s expensive. You were always known for taking your sweet development time. &quot;Soon,&quot; we were told. &quot;It&#39;ll be done soon.&quot; And we knew that you were creating something beautiful and amazing that was, despite any flaws that might exist, going to be fun. &quot;Soon&quot; was almost always worth the wait. But you don&#39;t make those kinds of games anymore. And I wonder if you ever will again.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>Do you know why I logged onto World of Warcraft day after day those first few years? It wasn&#39;t because 15-minute corpse runs were fun. It wasn&#39;t so I could wait for the warlock to farm soul shards or for the hunter to travel all the way back to a village to buy arrows before we could finally spend the next 5 hours being lost in Dire Maul. It wasn&#39;t to craft copper bars or gather runecloth so I could buy a cross-racial mount. Though, I did all of those things, and many, many more.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#39;t logging on to earn or buy loot boxes. I didn&#39;t finish a dungeon and hope that whatever the final boss dropped would not only be the thing I wanted, but also titanforge into a super-powered version of the thing I wanted. I didn&#39;t log on so I could fill a bar - though there were plenty of bars to fill. I didn&#39;t play so I could gather some random source of power that would inevitably fade into irrelevance as soon as some goblin miner discovered a new random source of power. I didn&#39;t show up to race through dungeons or to replace pieces of gear every other day with gear that was marginally better (or worse) than what I was wearing.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>In fact, I think I wore the same robe for 2 years during classic WoW. I only replaced it after The Burning Crusade released. I didn&#39;t log on just so I could tab-out to third-party websites because they were the only way to find out if I had the right talents, the right gear, or to simulate numbers with the gear I did have. I didn&#39;t pay $15 a month to earn a score from a third-party so I could participate in the game with other people who valued my random score over my experience playing the game.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>I played World of Warcraft because just being in Azeroth with a few friends was good enough. I wasn&#39;t worried about leveling up quickly so I could &quot;play the real game&quot; like people are today. If I set out to do some quests, but got distracted by PvP (corpse runs) or a dungeon (corpse runs), or exploring a zone that was full of monsters just a bit too powerful for my level (more corpse runs), then that was all right. Because exploring Azeroth - an enormous world full of amazing creatures and hidden things - was a lot of fun.</p>\n\n<p>\u200b</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re deluding yourself if you think that classic World of Warcraft will bring that all back. It won&#39;t. It can&#39;t. That experience can&#39;t be replicated any more than returning to Disneyland as an adult can recreate the first time I visited when I was 10 years old.

Not a single wipe.\n\nThe guy who initiated the kick said he did not have time for some low dps in the group,  that was the reason he wanted to kick him.\n\nI took a quick look at his achivement points, 550 in total.

        "selftext": "EDIT2: r/Roll20 staff just made [an announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/9j6k9s/subreddit_status_and_moderation_changes/). \n\nEDIT: [Please Be Civil When Talking To/About The Roll20 Staff](https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/9j3z9m/please_be_civil_when_talking_toabout_the_roll20/)\n\n----\n\nThis is a _long_ post, quoting multiple comments from various sources in case the original sources get deleted as a result of this post. \n\nTL;DR: r/Roll20 admin u/NolanT banned me from the subreddit for criticizing Roll20. Roll20 customer support backed him in his decision.\n\nI have been a paying member of Roll20 for 5 years, using it to run my D&D games, both in person (with a TV battlemat) and online. I have routinely told people online and in real life it is the best virtual tabletop on the market, and I've gotten a dozen or so friends onto it personally. \n\nI just canceled _and deleted_ my Roll20 account due to their customer service.\n\nA few days ago, I get a message on Reddit that I had been banned from r/Roll20. I thought, _This must be a mistake. I've barely ever posted there, let alone done anything abusive._ \n\nAs it turns out, I've only ever posted there twice, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/9hq97c/how_do_you_dms_prep_your_jukebox/e6egf55/?context=1) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/9hwqoz/is_criticism_of_roll20_allowed_here/e6fmwzj/), both three days ago. I believe it is that second comment which caused NolanT to ban me. _If that comment gets deleted, the content was basically a copy-paste of [this comment I had made on r/DMAcademy](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/9ha9yo/z/e6bd2bx)._\n\n[Here's what the ban message said.](https://imgur.com/yjdQjWp)\n\n----\n\n> You have been banned from participating in r/Roll20. You can still view and subscribe to r/Roll20, but you won't be able to post or comment.\n>\n> Note from the moderators:\n>\n>> You were banned from this subreddit approximately a year ago. We are banning your alternate account as well.\n> \n> If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for r/Roll20 by replying to this message.\n>\n> Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.\n\n----\n\nBanned a year ago? I'd never even used that subbreddit until this week. And I don't even _have_ an alternate account, let alone one that had been banned. I figured there must have been a mistake. And the fact that this threatens to possibly ban my account from Reddit altogether, I became upset.\n\n[I sent a message, asking for clarification and correction.](https://imgur.com/DuxQddH) \n\n----\n\n> What is this about? I don't have an alternate account. Look at the history of this account. I've used it for 5 years. I've done nothing worthy of a ban. This must be a mistake. Please respond.\n\n----\n\n[I received a response a few hours later, from the admin, u/NolanT.](https://imgur.com/rAimAWv)\n\n----\n\n> https://www.reddit.com/user/apostleoftruth/\n>\n> Too similar a posting style; not taking the risk on coincidence. Don't have a way to check IP here on reddit, so we'll be erring on the side of caution.\n\n----\n\nI thought, _Wow, that username_ is _suspiciously similar to mine. Fair enough. How close are our posting patterns?_ So, I checked with a tool I've used in the past for getting statistical data of Reddit users' posting patterns: https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/. \n\nYou can view the analyses here:\n\n* https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleo\n* https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleoftruth\n\n\nIt shows that u/apostleoftruth and I have quite different posting patterns. I became more upset, feeling like this was based on nothing other than my username. \n\nI then got curious. _What did apostleoftruth do to get banned in the first place?_ I figured it would have been some verbal abuse, as is so common on Reddit. The analyzer doesn't show him as being _terribly_ toxic, at least on the statistical level. And his most downvoted comment of all time was only -7. But what stood out to me about that comment was its content. It was criticizing Roll20. I thought, alright, maybe he got a bit heated in a comment at some point and said something out of line. I looked through his comment history to find the last time he had posted/commented in r/Roll20. \n\n[Here is his last post on r/Roll20.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/722mb7/passive_aggressiveness_in_pro_forums/)\n\n----\n\n> I recently had the opportunity to look at the pro forums at a specific thread.\n> \n> https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/5565388/can-we-have-a-serious-discussion-about-paid-gming\n> \n> In this thread, the OP is making his remarks about paid GMing, a heated and controversial topic that has been going on around for quite a while. The thread ends with Nolan going on his usual defensive stance by bringing the code of conduct, he, of course, fails to mention what the link to the code was for and in a very cold manner. In that same post, we also get some new information about when we can flag pay to play posts and what their intention is (which by the way is not in the code of conduct's paid GMing).\n> \n> The OP in question has deleted their account. And by the flair, you can see that they were a Pro user. The user clearly had a problem with paid GMing (perhaps a mishap in the past) and instead of entering a civil discussion to convince him otherwise, a dev response shuts down the thread and halts the conversation.\n> I do not know about you, but this is breaking the code of conduct of Roll20 in its entirety. Specifically, it is an infringement of common courtesy and civil discussion rules.\n> \n> I would understand shutting down any other topics that are either off-topic or offensive outside of Pro forums due to how easy it is to spam it, but in the Pro forums, you only have paying members posting. The current norm in Pro forums is that if someone brings a topic that demands discussion it gets a single response from devs and then shut down unless it is in the interest of the devs to respond to. This passive aggressive, mild-dictatorial stance is casuing user opinions to get shut down.\n> \n> A pro user just left, that is a minus in Roll20's revenue and this is due to a lack of interest from the devs to keep their top tier paying users in.\n> \n> Consider this topic as an announcement. I do not expect replies or visibility but I had to raise my voice for the guy who deleted his account feeling betrayed by Roll20.\n\n----\n\n[In that same thread, NolanT makes a comment stating that he had banned the user.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/722mb7/passive_aggressiveness_in_pro_forums/dng38pg/)\n\n----\n\n> Firstly, I've gone ahead and removed /u/ApostleofTruth from the Roll20 subreddit. Their recent history of seeking every opportunity to drag the Roll20 staff on a subreddit that we curate makes it difficult to have a constructive conversation (doubly so as we're soon bringing on a new Community Manager). My hope is that by removing the most harassing elements of these (and other) ecosystems, we'll be better able to facilitate publicly interacting with the community's concerns.\n> \n> To the discussion in this thread about forum moderation; for us, Paid GMing is a closed conversation. For those who aren't Pro users, my response to the thread was as follows:\n> \n>> We view paid GMing as a choice similar what rule set a group utilizes; a question of consent between those choosing to participate in a game that warrants no input from those not part of the game. Just as someone might say that, \"4th Edition Dungeons & Dragons is a terrible roleplaying experience and not what was ever intended by TSR,\" the fact that someone else is playing that game doesn't stop you from having a 2nd Edition game or playing Pathfinder. To dispel a few conceptions; paid GMing is not a particular large portion of the games played on Roll20, similar to how few games on Roll20 are actually a result of our Looking for Group system or forums. Checking with our Customer Support Representative, \"the amount of emails we get in regards potential scams from Paid GMing does not even fill up one hand.\" As far as our intentions we do not intend for paid GM's to be responding to others that are searching for groups unless specifically requested, and we will continue to take moderator action against such replies (and if you see such a response yourself, please FLAG IT to help us get to it faster). Additionally, as we improve our Looking for Group search tool, we intend to continue to offer options to remove or highlight paid postings per your individual preferences.\n> \n> As for locking the thread, the content was essentially off-topic. Like many other products-- particularly software as a service ones-- we actually don't want to have a forum community. It's not that there aren't some really excellent people (because by and large, wow, have we been lucky), but there is a small segment that continuously look to cause sweeping debates on such forums. In this particular thread's case-- outside of the initial poster being off-topic and expecting said sweeping debate to occur-- the thread was amazing. Yet, by allowing such a thing to be open, it makes for a future argument as to why the Roll20 forums needs to allow verbal fencing over the merits of rules-heavy vs rules-light play, etc. As such, we have an extremely narrow focus on our forums-- looking for other players, reporting bugs, requesting features, troubleshooting the program, and working on things like our API or character sheets.\n> \n> All of that said, there is an impetus on us at Roll20 to find ways to facilitate some of the more soul-searching community questions folks have as to the philosophies and intent we have for the program. I'll be on Twitch tomorrow at 1PM PT discussing those sorts of things, and I would like to get such conversations to be a more regular part of our interactions.\n\n----\n\nNow I'm not just angry for myself, but for this other guy who got banned a year ago. He got banned for criticizing Roll20, and pointing out moderation abuse trying to quash criticism. Ironically, I never would have known about the history of mod abuse if NolanT hadn't pointed me to it himself. One particular part of NolanT's comment was infuriating:\n\n> Like many other products-- particularly software as a service ones-- we actually don't want to have a forum community.\n\nWell that's readily apparent at this point.\n\nAt this point I'm fuming, but I decide to keep my appeal as courteous as possible, if only to maximize my chances of having the ban reversed.\n\n[I sent my appeal with the above statistical evidence.](https://imgur.com/BZv1Gax) \n\n----\n\n>> Too similar a posting style\n>\n> How so? Text analysis shows our styles are not similar at all. Moreover, our posting patterns are entirely different. We frequent different subreddits.\n> \n> https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleo\n>\n> https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleoftruth\n>\n> I don't know if this factors into your decision at all, but look at my Roll20 account: https://app.roll20.net/users/107573/apostleo. I have spent hundreds of dollars on Roll20. I've been a paid member since 2013, almost the entirety of Roll20's existence. If this isn't overturned, I'm going to cancel my Roll20 account immediately.\n\n----\n\nI received no response for a day. I got more upset. Is this something silly to be getting worked up about? Sure. But on top of threatening to ban my account from Reddit, this had become a matter of principle. I was being wrongfully accused and punished, then my appeal was being ignored. And this was turning out to be part of an ongoing pattern of mod abuse.\n\n[I sent a follow-up.](https://imgur.com/DJapRxs) \n\n----\n\n> u/NolanT, It's been 24 hours now, I'm still banned, and you haven't responded to my evidence of my defense. If you truly believed that this was an alternate account, you could escalate the issues to a Reddit admin to verify the IPs and ban me altogether. I wish you would try, because they could confirm my claim that I am a different person.\n>\n> You're going to take a 5-year paying customer and promoter of your service and turn them into an active detractor on social media.\n\n----\n\n_[Here's the full message chain, to show I'm not omitting something.](https://imgur.com/I5SDVvO)_\n\n[I also sent an email to Roll20 support directly, at team@roll20.net](https://imgur.com/GwHBnYb)\n\n----\n\n> Your forum admin, NolanT, banned me from your subreddit, r/Roll20. He claims that he believes my account is an alternate account of someone he temporarily banned a year ago. I've given evidence that this is not the case (textual analysis of our posting histories shows very different patterns), but he has not responded. I've done nothing worthy of a ban. I have been a paying member of Roll20 since 2013, and I've purchased many things through the Roll20 Marketplace. I expect the ban to be lifted and an apology given by NolanT by the time of billing for next month, or I am going to cancel my subscription. You will not only be losing a long-time customer and promoter of your service, but you will be making an active detractor on social media. \n>\n> Reddit account: https://www.reddit.com/user/ApostleO\n> Roll20 account: https://app.roll20.net/users/107573/apostleo\n>\n> Thank you,\n> Cory\n\n----\n\nAgain, I received no response for over a day. Now I was not just upset at NolanT, but at Roll20's support in general. \n\n[I sent another message to the r/Roll20 moderator queue (rather than just u/NolanT) and another email, pretty much the same content, outlining all the facts above.](https://imgur.com/nluYwdi)\n\n----\n\n> It's been 36 hours since I sent the previous email. I have received no response. I'll provide additional details of the issue, in case they are needed.\n> \n> \n> \n> I received a ban notification on Reddit a couple days ago, notifying me that I had been banned from r/Roll20. \n> \n> > Note from the moderators:\n> > \n> >> You were banned from this subreddit approximately a year ago.

I have not received a response. How do you recommend a paying customer actually receive customer service regarding your product and forums?\n\n----\n\n[Finally, I received a response, via email.](https://imgur.com/TNEwYH0)\n\n----\n\n> Hi Cory Owens,\n> We had reached out to Reddit admins to confirm or deny whether or not the other account shared an IP address. However, this influx of messages-- particularly in response to a ban from a sub reddit where you have only posted twice-- has cause for concern, just as much as the initial belief of ban evasion.\n> \n> It is due to this concern that we will be maintaining your ban from our sub reddit.\n> \n> Regards,\n>\n> Miles\n\n----\n\nI couldn't believe what I was reading. I still can't believe it.

I still believe that Roll20 is the best virtual table top available, despite its many, _many_, _**many**_ faults. _(It's like that old adage about democracy. \"Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.\")_ So, I'll be losing out by canceling, and possibly hurting my own campaigns I'm running. But I am the sort of person who doesn't make idle threats, so I felt I had to follow through, and I refuse to monetarily support a company that would insult me and call me a liar. \n\nAnd so, as I stated in my emails, I'm telling this story to anyone who will listen. I'm going to be trying [Fantasy Grounds](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/), [GM Forge](https://store.steampowered.com/app/842250/GM_Forge__Virtual_Tabletop/), [MapTool](https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/maptool/), and any other options I can find. _(Maybe I'll start working on a virtual tabletop service of my own.)_\n\nIf you have complaints about Roll20, but you are sticking around hoping it will improve, I would recommend you bail as well, because it is quite apparent that they are vehemently opposed to hearing criticism. \n\nThanks for your time.

Roll20 customer support backed him in his decision.</p>\n\n<p>I have been a paying member of Roll20 for 5 years, using it to run my D&amp;D games, both in person (with a TV battlemat) and online. I have routinely told people online and in real life it is the best virtual tabletop on the market, and I&#39;ve gotten a dozen or so friends onto it personally. </p>\n\n<p>I just canceled <em>and deleted</em> my Roll20 account due to their customer service.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, I get a message on Reddit that I had been banned from <a href=\"/r/Roll20\">r/Roll20</a>. I thought, <em>This must be a mistake. I&#39;ve barely ever posted there, let alone done anything abusive.</em> </p>\n\n<p>As it turns out, I&#39;ve only ever posted there twice, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/9hq97c/how_do_you_dms_prep_your_jukebox/e6egf55/?context=1\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/9hwqoz/is_criticism_of_roll20_allowed_here/e6fmwzj/\">here</a>, both three days ago. I believe it is that second comment which caused NolanT to ban me. <em>If that comment gets deleted, the content was basically a copy-paste of <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/9ha9yo/z/e6bd2bx\">this comment I had made on r/DMAcademy</a>.</em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/yjdQjWp\">Here&#39;s what the ban message said.</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You have been banned from participating in <a href=\"/r/Roll20\">r/Roll20</a>. You can still view and subscribe to <a href=\"/r/Roll20\">r/Roll20</a>, but you won&#39;t be able to post or comment.</p>\n\n<p>Note from the moderators:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You were banned from this subreddit approximately a year ago. We are banning your alternate account as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for <a href=\"/r/Roll20\">r/Roll20</a> by replying to this message.</p>\n\n<p>Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Banned a year ago? I&#39;d never even used that subbreddit until this week. And I don&#39;t even <em>have</em> an alternate account, let alone one that had been banned. I figured there must have been a mistake. And the fact that this threatens to possibly ban my account from Reddit altogether, I became upset.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/DuxQddH\">I sent a message, asking for clarification and correction.</a> </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is this about? I don&#39;t have an alternate account. Look at the history of this account. I&#39;ve used it for 5 years. I&#39;ve done nothing worthy of a ban. This must be a mistake. Please respond.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/rAimAWv\">I received a response a few hours later, from the admin, u/NolanT.</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/apostleoftruth/\">https://www.reddit.com/user/apostleoftruth/</a></p>\n\n<p>Too similar a posting style; not taking the risk on coincidence. Don&#39;t have a way to check IP here on reddit, so we&#39;ll be erring on the side of caution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I thought, <em>Wow, that username</em> is <em>suspiciously similar to mine. Fair enough. How close are our posting patterns?</em> So, I checked with a tool I&#39;ve used in the past for getting statistical data of Reddit users&#39; posting patterns: <a href=\"https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/\">https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/</a>. </p>\n\n<p>You can view the analyses here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleo\">https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleo</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleoftruth\">https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleoftruth</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It shows that <a href=\"/u/apostleoftruth\">u/apostleoftruth</a> and I have quite different posting patterns. I became more upset, feeling like this was based on nothing other than my username. </p>\n\n<p>I then got curious. <em>What did apostleoftruth do to get banned in the first place?</em> I figured it would have been some verbal abuse, as is so common on Reddit. The analyzer doesn&#39;t show him as being <em>terribly</em> toxic, at least on the statistical level. And his most downvoted comment of all time was only -7. But what stood out to me about that comment was its content. It was criticizing Roll20. I thought, alright, maybe he got a bit heated in a comment at some point and said something out of line. I looked through his comment history to find the last time he had posted/commented in <a href=\"/r/Roll20\">r/Roll20</a>. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/722mb7/passive_aggressiveness_in_pro_forums/\">Here is his last post on r/Roll20.</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I recently had the opportunity to look at the pro forums at a specific thread.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/5565388/can-we-have-a-serious-discussion-about-paid-gming\">https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/5565388/can-we-have-a-serious-discussion-about-paid-gming</a></p>\n\n<p>In this thread, the OP is making his remarks about paid GMing, a heated and controversial topic that has been going on around for quite a while. The thread ends with Nolan going on his usual defensive stance by bringing the code of conduct, he, of course, fails to mention what the link to the code was for and in a very cold manner. In that same post, we also get some new information about when we can flag pay to play posts and what their intention is (which by the way is not in the code of conduct&#39;s paid GMing).</p>\n\n<p>The OP in question has deleted their account. And by the flair, you can see that they were a Pro user. The user clearly had a problem with paid GMing (perhaps a mishap in the past) and instead of entering a civil discussion to convince him otherwise, a dev response shuts down the thread and halts the conversation.\nI do not know about you, but this is breaking the code of conduct of Roll20 in its entirety. Specifically, it is an infringement of common courtesy and civil discussion rules.</p>\n\n<p>I would understand shutting down any other topics that are either off-topic or offensive outside of Pro forums due to how easy it is to spam it, but in the Pro forums, you only have paying members posting. The current norm in Pro forums is that if someone brings a topic that demands discussion it gets a single response from devs and then shut down unless it is in the interest of the devs to respond to. This passive aggressive, mild-dictatorial stance is casuing user opinions to get shut down.</p>\n\n<p>A pro user just left, that is a minus in Roll20&#39;s revenue and this is due to a lack of interest from the devs to keep their top tier paying users in.</p>\n\n<p>Consider this topic as an announcement. I do not expect replies or visibility but I had to raise my voice for the guy who deleted his account feeling betrayed by Roll20.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Roll20/comments/722mb7/passive_aggressiveness_in_pro_forums/dng38pg/\">In that same thread, NolanT makes a comment stating that he had banned the user.</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, I&#39;ve gone ahead and removed <a href=\"/u/ApostleofTruth\">/u/ApostleofTruth</a> from the Roll20 subreddit. Their recent history of seeking every opportunity to drag the Roll20 staff on a subreddit that we curate makes it difficult to have a constructive conversation (doubly so as we&#39;re soon bringing on a new Community Manager). My hope is that by removing the most harassing elements of these (and other) ecosystems, we&#39;ll be better able to facilitate publicly interacting with the community&#39;s concerns.</p>\n\n<p>To the discussion in this thread about forum moderation; for us, Paid GMing is a closed conversation. For those who aren&#39;t Pro users, my response to the thread was as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>We view paid GMing as a choice similar what rule set a group utilizes; a question of consent between those choosing to participate in a game that warrants no input from those not part of the game. Just as someone might say that, &quot;4th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons is a terrible roleplaying experience and not what was ever intended by TSR,&quot; the fact that someone else is playing that game doesn&#39;t stop you from having a 2nd Edition game or playing Pathfinder. To dispel a few conceptions; paid GMing is not a particular large portion of the games played on Roll20, similar to how few games on Roll20 are actually a result of our Looking for Group system or forums. Checking with our Customer Support Representative, &quot;the amount of emails we get in regards potential scams from Paid GMing does not even fill up one hand.&quot; As far as our intentions we do not intend for paid GM&#39;s to be responding to others that are searching for groups unless specifically requested, and we will continue to take moderator action against such replies (and if you see such a response yourself, please FLAG IT to help us get to it faster). Additionally, as we improve our Looking for Group search tool, we intend to continue to offer options to remove or highlight paid postings per your individual preferences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for locking the thread, the content was essentially off-topic. Like many other products-- particularly software as a service ones-- we actually don&#39;t want to have a forum community. It&#39;s not that there aren&#39;t some really excellent people (because by and large, wow, have we been lucky), but there is a small segment that continuously look to cause sweeping debates on such forums. In this particular thread&#39;s case-- outside of the initial poster being off-topic and expecting said sweeping debate to occur-- the thread was amazing. Yet, by allowing such a thing to be open, it makes for a future argument as to why the Roll20 forums needs to allow verbal fencing over the merits of rules-heavy vs rules-light play, etc. As such, we have an extremely narrow focus on our forums-- looking for other players, reporting bugs, requesting features, troubleshooting the program, and working on things like our API or character sheets.</p>\n\n<p>All of that said, there is an impetus on us at Roll20 to find ways to facilitate some of the more soul-searching community questions folks have as to the philosophies and intent we have for the program. I&#39;ll be on Twitch tomorrow at 1PM PT discussing those sorts of things, and I would like to get such conversations to be a more regular part of our interactions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Now I&#39;m not just angry for myself, but for this other guy who got banned a year ago. He got banned for criticizing Roll20, and pointing out moderation abuse trying to quash criticism. Ironically, I never would have known about the history of mod abuse if NolanT hadn&#39;t pointed me to it himself. One particular part of NolanT&#39;s comment was infuriating:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Like many other products-- particularly software as a service ones-- we actually don&#39;t want to have a forum community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well that&#39;s readily apparent at this point.</p>\n\n<p>At this point I&#39;m fuming, but I decide to keep my appeal as courteous as possible, if only to maximize my chances of having the ban reversed.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/BZv1Gax\">I sent my appeal with the above statistical evidence.</a> </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Too similar a posting style</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How so? Text analysis shows our styles are not similar at all. Moreover, our posting patterns are entirely different. We frequent different subreddits.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleo\">https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleo</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleoftruth\">https://atomiks.github.io/reddit-user-analyser/#apostleoftruth</a></p>\n\n<p>I don&#39;t know if this factors into your decision at all, but look at my Roll20 account: <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/107573/apostleo\">https://app.roll20.net/users/107573/apostleo</a>. I have spent hundreds of dollars on Roll20. I&#39;ve been a paid member since 2013, almost the entirety of Roll20&#39;s existence. If this isn&#39;t overturned, I&#39;m going to cancel my Roll20 account immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>I received no response for a day. I got more upset. Is this something silly to be getting worked up about? Sure. But on top of threatening to ban my account from Reddit, this had become a matter of principle. I was being wrongfully accused and punished, then my appeal was being ignored. And this was turning out to be part of an ongoing pattern of mod abuse.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/DJapRxs\">I sent a follow-up.</a> </p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"/u/NolanT\">u/NolanT</a>, It&#39;s been 24 hours now, I&#39;m still banned, and you haven&#39;t responded to my evidence of my defense.

I wish you would try, because they could confirm my claim that I am a different person.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re going to take a 5-year paying customer and promoter of your service and turn them into an active detractor on social media.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://imgur.com/I5SDVvO\">Here&#39;s the full message chain, to show I&#39;m not omitting something.</a></em></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/GwHBnYb\">I also sent an email to Roll20 support directly, at team@roll20.net</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Your forum admin, NolanT, banned me from your subreddit, <a href=\"/r/Roll20\">r/Roll20</a>. He claims that he believes my account is an alternate account of someone he temporarily banned a year ago. I&#39;ve given evidence that this is not the case (textual analysis of our posting histories shows very different patterns), but he has not responded. I&#39;ve done nothing worthy of a ban. I have been a paying member of Roll20 since 2013, and I&#39;ve purchased many things through the Roll20 Marketplace. I expect the ban to be lifted and an apology given by NolanT by the time of billing for next month, or I am going to cancel my subscription. You will not only be losing a long-time customer and promoter of your service, but you will be making an active detractor on social media. </p>\n\n<p>Reddit account: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/ApostleO\">https://www.reddit.com/user/ApostleO</a>\nRoll20 account: <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/107573/apostleo\">https://app.roll20.net/users/107573/apostleo</a></p>\n\n<p>Thank you,\nCory</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Again, I received no response for over a day. Now I was not just upset at NolanT, but at Roll20&#39;s support in general. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/nluYwdi\">I sent another message to the r/Roll20 moderator queue (rather than just u/NolanT) and another email, pretty much the same content, outlining all the facts above.</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It&#39;s been 36 hours since I sent the previous email. I have received no response. I&#39;ll provide additional details of the issue, in case they are needed.</p>\n\n<p>I received a ban notification on Reddit a couple days ago, notifying me that I had been banned from <a href=\"/r/Roll20\">r/Roll20</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note from the moderators:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>You were banned from this subreddit approximately a year ago.

Regardless if he had proof of his innocence or not, multiple BSG representatives have told me that no matter what, there is absolutely no discussion or unbans ever. Community Manager Natalino Carlo and from a confirmed BSG employee u/sova13 have said this.\n\n\nThis was in the email they sent me: \"The decision to block it is final and will not be reviewed.\" So, after all this, after the hundred or thousands.of innocent people like me who have been banned and got the same.response, Tweak was unbanned faster that I can take a shit. They have lied to us, gone back on their word, and essentially stolen from me and others.\n\n\nNikita said the other day they banned 50,000 people last ban wave. Their anti cheat is by no means perfect, even if 1% of that is false, that means 500 people lost their accounts. 500 people that cant get a review, can't ever play Tarkov again.\n\n\nIt's crazy there was a hacker report of me that was put into the EFT forum. A few days later I banned. Tweak had the same.thing. There is never any confirmation about what we get banned for but if you get banned a few days after a hacker report, and it's looking crazy, then that's probably it. But, u/sova13 told me that video aren't used for bans and it's anti cheat only. So then why did Tweak's proof of innocence video work?\n\n I talked to.him on stream and he said that streamer are in a discord channel witth devs and he was able talk them, but he can't help me out. He even admitted \" I know it's not fair, but I can't help ya\" something along those lines. So he just take advantage of the cookies and gets to let me smell em, no taste though. I get it though, I would prolly do the same in his shoes.\n\n\nI understand that streamers bring in money. Guess my 140$ and the 6 or 7 friends I got.to.buy EOD don't matter. I guess anyone but a streamers doesn't matter? Just lie to everyone but make sure streamers are in tip top shape.\n\n\nThe clear favoritism shown is crazy. It's like the end user doesnt even matter to them. Just lie to them.\n\n\nI work in an ambulance as a medic. I work 48-72 hours a week and sometimes even more. My job is stressful AF, especially with corona rn, and I used Tarkov as a coping mechanism, as a way to wind down after work, as a way to socialize, to not be so goddamn depressed all the time,  to play with family, and just to enjoy life and what little free time I have. One of the most gut punches I've had is when Natalino Carlo banned me from the official discord barely an hour ago after I told him all this and told him that y'all do unban, cuz Tweak was unbanned. Just that not giving AF about you attitude actually kinda hurt.\n\n\nI just want a review, an explanation, and for.them to stop lying to us. Either say all bans are final and don't give special treatment to streamers or stop saying that And create an appeals process.\n\n\nIf you have or know of anyone that's experienced the same, share it, share your thoughts. Help me get this on the front page, at the very least we can agree that favoritism toward streamers gotta stop, it's almost like they are BSG employees or getting kickbacks or something. \n\n\nC'mon u/trainfender and u/sova13 why is this happening? Why does your team lie? Why did they kick me from the discord after hearing my story and dilemma? Why am I and others treated like we are crap when we are Tarkov?\n\n\n\nI was banned for nearly the same thing as Tweak, from my enemies POV it looked like I was floating/Usain bolting to cover. This was not the same in my screen. I have shitty connection frequently and BSG servers are not the best to begin with. \n\nBy the way, I have an EOD account. A 2.23 KD, and a 22% survival rate. I'm female, Im not from China. All the odds of me being a hacker are against. If that can help influence at all, my shitty stats say something.\n\n\nEveryone who's gonna say, gs ban hacker, haha you got banned, you deserved it etc. No  I didn't, and I'm not even gonna reply.\n\n\nWE ARE TARKOV! WE ARE THE PMC'S, THE SCAVS, THE COMMUNITY. WHY ARE WE TREATED LIKE THIS? \n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/Rl4C2SQ\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/1RRiJAT\n\n\nhttp://imgur.com/gallery/vfIQCN4\n\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has joined in on the post. I did not expect this response or the amount of actual real conversation and and civility we've had. Let's keep it up.\n\nEdit2: HOLY SHIT! Thanks for all the awards y'all,.it is very much appreciated. I'm doing my best to respond to everyone, my fingers are stirring to hurt tho, I apologise if I miss you \n\nEdit3: This is from a comment I've made, just wanted all to see \"I've don't alot of criticizing, but failed to give credit to BSG where it is due. They have done an amazing job and their stance on cheats, at the very least, is progression and they are working hard on it, just things need to change, stuff needs to be analyzed on how it is pushed out/operated, and listen to us. I feel like they do a lot more listening than most games, and maybe we're spoiled in that sense, idk\" They have done an amazing job on an amazing, I think the reason why there is so much attention on this because it is such an amazing game. I just wanna play it again \ud83d\ude36\n\nEdit 4: To all the naysayers etc etc, I truly.hope BSG gets on here with some sort of irrefutable evidence against me, prove me wrong. TELL ME WHY!

I guess anyone but a streamers doesn&#39;t matter? Just lie to everyone but make sure streamers are in tip top shape.</p>\n\n<p>The clear favoritism shown is crazy. It&#39;s like the end user doesnt even matter to them. Just lie to them.</p>\n\n<p>I work in an ambulance as a medic. I work 48-72 hours a week and sometimes even more. My job is stressful AF, especially with corona rn, and I used Tarkov as a coping mechanism, as a way to wind down after work, as a way to socialize, to not be so goddamn depressed all the time,  to play with family, and just to enjoy life and what little free time I have. One of the most gut punches I&#39;ve had is when Natalino Carlo banned me from the official discord barely an hour ago after I told him all this and told him that y&#39;all do unban, cuz Tweak was unbanned. Just that not giving AF about you attitude actually kinda hurt.</p>\n\n<p>I just want a review, an explanation, and for.them to stop lying to us. Either say all bans are final and don&#39;t give special treatment to streamers or stop saying that And create an appeals process.</p>\n\n<p>If you have or know of anyone that&#39;s experienced the same, share it, share your thoughts. Help me get this on the front page, at the very least we can agree that favoritism toward streamers gotta stop, it&#39;s almost like they are BSG employees or getting kickbacks or something. </p>\n\n<p>C&#39;mon <a href=\"/u/trainfender\">u/trainfender</a> and <a href=\"/u/sova13\">u/sova13</a> why is this happening? Why does your team lie? Why did they kick me from the discord after hearing my story and dilemma? Why am I and others treated like we are crap when we are Tarkov?</p>\n\n<p>I was banned for nearly the same thing as Tweak, from my enemies POV it looked like I was floating/Usain bolting to cover. This was not the same in my screen. I have shitty connection frequently and BSG servers are not the best to begin with. </p>\n\n<p>By the way, I have an EOD account. A 2.23 KD, and a 22% survival rate. I&#39;m female, Im not from China. All the odds of me being a hacker are against. If that can help influence at all, my shitty stats say something.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone who&#39;s gonna say, gs ban hacker, haha you got banned, you deserved it etc. No  I didn&#39;t, and I&#39;m not even gonna reply.</p>\n\n<p>WE ARE TARKOV! WE ARE THE PMC&#39;S, THE SCAVS, THE COMMUNITY. WHY ARE WE TREATED LIKE THIS? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/Rl4C2SQ\">http://imgur.com/gallery/Rl4C2SQ</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/1RRiJAT\">http://imgur.com/gallery/1RRiJAT</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://imgur.com/gallery/vfIQCN4\">http://imgur.com/gallery/vfIQCN4</a></p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has joined in on the post. I did not expect this response or the amount of actual real conversation and and civility we&#39;ve had. Let&#39;s keep it up.</p>\n\n<p>Edit2: HOLY SHIT! Thanks for all the awards y&#39;all,.it is very much appreciated. I&#39;m doing my best to respond to everyone, my fingers are stirring to hurt tho, I apologise if I miss you </p>\n\n<p>Edit3: This is from a comment I&#39;ve made, just wanted all to see &quot;I&#39;ve don&#39;t alot of criticizing, but failed to give credit to BSG where it is due. They have done an amazing job and their stance on cheats, at the very least, is progression and they are working hard on it, just things need to change, stuff needs to be analyzed on how it is pushed out/operated, and listen to us. I feel like they do a lot more listening than most games, and maybe we&#39;re spoiled in that sense, idk&quot; They have done an amazing job on an amazing, I think the reason why there is so much attention on this because it is such an amazing game. I just wanna play it again \ud83d\ude36</p>\n\n<p>Edit 4: To all the naysayers etc etc, I truly.hope BSG gets on here with some sort of irrefutable evidence against me, prove me wrong. TELL ME WHY! Cuz those vids were trash</p>\n\n<p>TL:DR Was banned. Spoke with BSG employees who states all bans are final no matter what, no discussion. Then why was Tweak unbanned? This sucks.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I get it if you dislike the impact they have on the environment. I get it if you think sports cars are too expensive and a hassle. I get it if you see a forty something guy in a BMW M3 and assume he's compensating for something. But realize that automotive enthusiasm is a huge part of life for a lot of people, and can often be the biggest connection they have to family members or friends. \n\nAs a car enthusiast, I look forward to increased electrification for a lower carbon footprint (and ridiculous torque for better acceleration).

She had her MacBook on my couch when I sat on it and broke it. Since it was completely my fault I offered to pay her the money for it and she agreed. She got it 3 years ago and it cost 2200 dollars at the time. I told her I'd wire you the money in a week to her bank account.\n\nShe's now emailed me saying that as per our conversation she's expecting the 2700 that I have agreed for!!!! I didn't know why she added the extra money so I got her number from my friend and called her to find her telling me she's now expecting me to pay for her new upgraded MacBook since she was \"upgrading anyway\". She said if I don't agree to do that she'll be suing me in small claims court. Can a judge agree to that?\n\nShould I wire her the $2,200 or should I just tell her go sue me?\n\n[Update:](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6dh9vh/super_awesome_update_sat_down_on_my_friends/)\n\nI went through every single comment from the 200+ ones and I sincerely thank each and every one of you.\n\nI did some research specifically for repairing the screen for the macbook and for her particular model it\u2019s around 310 for the screen + the labor cost so I wrote her back saying that since she didn't accept my initial offer of $2200, I\u2019m withdrawing that offer, and offering to pay for the repair cost. She sent me an email calling me a bitch and that she\u2019s going to take me to court.\n\nI got served a few days later and went to court. I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor. (I printed out the email I sent her and the mail she sent back refusing demanding the 2700 and calling me a bitch and saying we\u2019ll go to court + screenshots for the price quotes from different websites for a new/refurbished and the screen fix for her particular model) and gave it to the judge. I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I\u2019d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade. I tried to show him how it's clearly visible that she's trying to take advantage of me.\n\nShe gave the judge an attitude almost the whole time which really pissed the judge off and helped my case I guess. After listening to both of us he ruled that I pay 50% of the repair cost since she negligently left her laptop on the couch. So I'll only be paying not more than 200-250 dollars for the whole thing.\n\nIf it weren\u2019t for you guys I would\u2019ve paid $2,200 dollars instead of around $200 and I honestly loved her look at the end as we walked out.",

Original post from r/TwoXChromosomes by u/TipsyRussell\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTrigger Warnings: past and potential child sexual abuse, statutory rape, sex trafficking of a minor\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Matt Gaetz will be speaking at a high school near me next week. Below is the email that I sent the superintendent. All I have are my vote and my voice, it's past time I start utilizing both.\n\n[OOP](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wkm5v9/matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high_school_near/) (Aug 10), [update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wlsl7j/update_matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high/) (Aug 11), [update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wn4p45/2nd_update_matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high/) (Aug 13)\n\nE: I don't think this is yet concluded, and this post isn't really that active anymore, but I'll add the 3rd update in anyway: [update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wpy6o5/3rd_update_matt_gaetz_will_be_speaking_at_a_high/) (Aug 16)\n\nGood evening,\n\nI would like to voice my concern about the upcoming \"Academy Night\" at Niceville High School. As I understand it, this is an informational meeting where students interested in the service academies can meet with Matt Gaetz. I understand that in order to apply for service academies, students need a nomination from their representative, senator, or the vice president. The students NEED his endorsement, and there is nothing that your office can do about that, which again, I fully understand.\n\nMatt Gaetz is under federal investigation for having sex with a 17 year old girl (the news keeps calling this sex with a minor. In Florida, the age of consent is 18, so this isn't just \"sex with a minor\". That's rape.) and paying for her to travel across state lines, violating sex-trafficking laws.\n\nIt is absolutely vile that the school system would invite someone currently under investigation for rape and sex-trafficking into the school to speak to 17 year old girls and put them in a position where they have to ask him for a favor. This investigation has been ongoing for a long time, so the county has had plenty of time to come up with an alternative to allowing him to speak at the school. Any information he needs to give out can easily be done via email, or even a Zoom call with interested students and their parents.\n\nIt seems to me that the school system should not allow someone under investigation for sex with minors anywhere near a school, if for no other reason than out of an abundance of caution. Instead, however, you are quite literally giving him access to potential new victims, and directing them to ask him for something. I would think that the safety of students would be a top priority for Okaloosa County, but this decision leads me to believe otherwise. If a teacher is under federal investigation for sex with a student, does that teacher stay in the classroom teaching while the investigation is ongoing? I\u2019m fairly certain I know the answer.\n\nThank you for taking these concerns into consideration.\n\n# Update 1:\n\nUpdate - I sent the email to the superintendent and the school board. The only response I\u2019ve gotten is from one school board member. All she said was that she\u2019d follow up. Several people have been sending emails, and other people have been getting responses. This is what one woman posted about it on Facebook: The superintendent called me after he received my email. He said that Gaetz does this event every year. It looks like it will continue to be held at Niceville High, with Gaetz as the presenter. Chambers told me that he spoke with Gaetz and was reassured that no agenda would be pushed, and there would be no speech, he would simply be handing out the assignments to students.\u201d\n\nAgain, this is not a response that I personally got, just one that I heard about.\n\nThis is not an acceptable response. Gaetz speaking to the students individually is worse than him giving a speech. At least with a speech, everyone can hear what is being said. Instead, he'll be interacting with the students one on one. Also, just because Gaetz has always done the event doesn\u2019t mean that it can\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be changed. I\u2019ll be sending a follow-up email tonight. I'm going to suggest that if the superintendent refuses to cancel, at the least, he can require parents' attendance.\n\nI encourage anyone that feels compelled to send an email as well to do so. I\u2019m not going to post contact info, but it\u2019s easily accessible on the Okaloosa County School District site.\n\nFinally, I'd like to thank everybody for the amazing comments and messages and awards. I was so nervous to post that, and everybody was just so encouraging, so thank you again, so so so much. It has done a lot to encourage me to keep going.\n\n# Update 2:\n\nI wrote a follow-up email this morning and sent it to the superintendent and copied the school board. I included a link the first post, and let them know that it had gotten almost 3 million views, and the overwhelming majority of the comments agreed with me. I suggested that they take a look at some of your comments and realize that this is a serious issue. Then I asked what the county\u2019s protocol is if a teacher is under investigation for having sex with a student \u2013 is that teacher allowed to remain in the classroom? I also asked at what point does the school/county become liable if Gaetz meets his next \u201cgirlfriend\u201d at an event like this, and the county did nothing to prevent it? I mentioned that I had not heard from anyone, but that I was aware that Mr. Chambers (the superintendent) had been responding to others, and that the gist of his response seems to be shrugging the whole thing off. I ended with \u201cI don't have a child in the school system, but I am a taxpayer and a voter. I've been in contact with a reporter from Newsweek, and I have no intention of dropping this.\u201d\n\nA few hours later, I got a call from the superintendent. I\u2019m not gonna lie, this is so far out of my wheelhouse. I was so nervous. I knew I would be posting an update, so I wanted to record the conversation just to make sure I accurately quoted him. I asked if I could record the call, and he said he\u2019d rather not, that he just wanted to have a conversation. I assume it was for the same reason that he\u2019s responding to emails with phone calls in the first place \u2013 to not have a record of what he has said. He gave me the same spiel he\u2019s giving everybody else. It\u2019s not his event, he\u2019ll be there, most of the parents will be in attendance, blah blah blah. I let him know that it\u2019s at a school, so ultimately it IS his event. He did agree with that. He started by saying that it\u2019s an investigation and there were no charges or arrests. I asked if they would wait for charges to be filed and an arrest to be made if it were a teacher. Would that teacher still be in the classroom? He said no, they would be put on administrative leave. I asked what the difference was and he paused and said \u201cyou would win that argument\u201d but didn\u2019t go any further. I wish I would have pushed him more on that.\n\nHe did try to tell me that that he wasn't going to be pushing a political agenda. I shut that down and said that that was not the issue. The issue is putting teenagers in front of a known predator.\n\nI asked about what the school\u2019s liability would be if it turned out Gaetz was guilty and he had been using these events to meet high school girls. He said he didn\u2019t think that would happen, which leads me to believe he doesn\u2019t believe the allegations. When we had discussed the process for what happens when a teacher is suspected of having sex with a student, he had said the sheriff\u2019s office would conduct an investigation. I reminded him that it\u2019s not the school or the county or the sheriff\u2019s office that\u2019s investigating Matt Gaetz, that it\u2019s the federal government, and that it's real and it\u2019s serious. I also pointed out that Gaetz\u2019s cohort has already pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing, which has been delayed because he\u2019s fully cooperating in the investigation into Gaetz\n\nHe said that the event was an important opportunity for the students. I agreed, and said that getting the chance to get facetime with their congressman is a huge opportunity for students, but that their safety was more important. I suggested that if he wouldn\u2019t cancel, then the least he could do would be to require parents\u2019 attendance. He said that wasn\u2019t something he considered. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s still not considering it, but at least it is hopefully planting ideas in his head that this is ultimately his responsibility, and there ARE options. I also suggested permission slips or waivers. At least make them acknowledge that he\u2019s a creep (allegedly).\n\nThe superintendent said that he IS getting a bunch of calls and emails, including a call from the New York Times, so that\u2019s exciting. Hopefully if we just keep it up, they school district will come to their senses. As one commenter said \u201cgod, the bar is just so low\u201d. We\u2019re not asking for much, just that you don\u2019t serve up teenage girls to an accused pedophile on a platter.\n\nAnyway, I will say I\u2019m proud of myself for standing my ground and not letting the superintendent shirk responsibility. He kept saying it wasn\u2019t the school\u2019s event, so I kept pointing out that it didn\u2019t matter whose event it was, it\u2019s happening at the school, and he is in charge of the schools. I was relatively articulate and stood my ground, so that felt good.\n\nAt this point, I\u2019m in too deep to just drop it. I think I actually told him that too, now that I think about it. So I\u2019m trying to get this all out there as much as I can. All but one of the board members are up for re-election on August 23rd. I haven\u2019t heard from any of them except for one email from one of them that she would follow up, and then nothing. So I sent my post to all their opponents in the election and told them that it might be a good opportunity to blast the incumbent for inaction. I feel like there\u2019s definitely traction, and a tiny possibility that MAYBE we can get something changed.\n\nThis has been a really weird couple of days. It\u2019s been incredibly nerve-wracking, but also, it feels incredible! I highly recommend everybody tries getting involved. Everybody\u2019s comments and messages have really been so encouraging so thank you all for that.\n\nThe superintendent is getting your calls and emails, so please keep it up, ESPECIALLY if there is anybody in here that lives in Okaloosa County! Academy Night is scheduled for Tuesday, so we have until then to get it canceled. Thanks Reddit!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n# Update 3:\n\nThis one will be brief - the event is still scheduled and Gaetz is still attending. Thanks to you guys though, we are getting national attention! [Newsweek published this article this morning](https://www.newsweek.com/matt-gaetz-sparks-outrage-over-hosting-high-school-event-1734014), and I believe Vanity Fair should be publishing one shortly as well (I'll update the post with that link when it comes out). Thank you so so much to everyone that has participated in this discussion and for all of the many encouraging and helpful messages I have received from all over. I haven't gotten a chance to reply to all of them, but I truly appreciate them. Covid finally caught a hold of me, and I've been laid up since the weekend, but I've read them all.\n\nI keep telling myself that even if this event doesn't get cancelled, this post and the public outcry has brought some much-needed attention to the issue, and hopefully people that were all-in on voting for Gaetz are reconsidering their position.\n\nOn a personal note, if you have thought about getting more involved and haven't because you don't feel like it will do any good - do it! It'll feel great!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\---------------------------------------------\n\nEdit to add [Top comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wkm5v9/comment/ijo94pj/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from OOP to help clear something up:\n\nThis is fantastic and very well written. Also, **as a grad of a federal service academy, I never actually met with any of the Congress people to whom I applied for my service academy nomination. It is not at all necessary for them to meet him in person.** Just validating your premise here.\n\n\\--------------------------------------------\n\n# Reminder - I am not the original poster\n\nE: I appreciate the awards, but please, if you're going to spend some money today, consider looking up an organisation and/or shelter that supports survivors of sex trafficking near you, or if you want to keep it more local to the post, I looked up a couple in Florida: [Kristi house](https://kristihouse.org/donate/) and ~~Naples shelter~~ (I did check both on Charity Navigator and they scored high, but I've had a comment saying the second has mistreated both staff and clients, so maybe not them).\n\nEdit again: just to point out there is a comment near/at the top here that contains the relevant contact information for those involved if anyone is interested, and also [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/wndvui/comment/ik5c91h/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) comment from OOP with link to a [tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1425301695945392130) by Matt Gaetz saying he and Marcus Chambers are friends.\n\nEdit once more to add [this](https://www.facebook.com/118144946259472/posts/pfbid03fRKvKbPxtFS9QGaTCxLRsmrA3beWdwkgBsNgmZJSLqTzBoKar24PkmTQGVwJ1A4l/?d=n) link to a post the superintendent made on FB, if you're on FB and can go comment asking about this whole Gaetz situation, please do!",

I asked what the difference was and he paused and said \u201cyou would win that argument\u201d but didn\u2019t go any further. I wish I would have pushed him more on that.</p>\n\n<p>He did try to tell me that that he wasn&#39;t going to be pushing a political agenda. I shut that down and said that that was not the issue. The issue is putting teenagers in front of a known predator.</p>\n\n<p>I asked about what the school\u2019s liability would be if it turned out Gaetz was guilty and he had been using these events to meet high school girls. He said he didn\u2019t think that would happen, which leads me to believe he doesn\u2019t believe the allegations. When we had discussed the process for what happens when a teacher is suspected of having sex with a student, he had said the sheriff\u2019s office would conduct an investigation. I reminded him that it\u2019s not the school or the county or the sheriff\u2019s office that\u2019s investigating Matt Gaetz, that it\u2019s the federal government, and that it&#39;s real and it\u2019s serious. I also pointed out that Gaetz\u2019s cohort has already pled guilty and is awaiting sentencing, which has been delayed because he\u2019s fully cooperating in the investigation into Gaetz</p>\n\n<p>He said that the event was an important opportunity for the students. I agreed, and said that getting the chance to get facetime with their congressman is a huge opportunity for students, but that their safety was more important. I suggested that if he wouldn\u2019t cancel, then the least he could do would be to require parents\u2019 attendance. He said that wasn\u2019t something he considered. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s still not considering it, but at least it is hopefully planting ideas in his head that this is ultimately his responsibility, and there ARE options. I also suggested permission slips or waivers. At least make them acknowledge that he\u2019s a creep (allegedly).</p>\n\n<p>The superintendent said that he IS getting a bunch of calls and emails, including a call from the New York Times, so that\u2019s exciting. Hopefully if we just keep it up, they school district will come to their senses. As one commenter said \u201cgod, the bar is just so low\u201d. We\u2019re not asking for much, just that you don\u2019t serve up teenage girls to an accused pedophile on a platter.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, I will say I\u2019m proud of myself for standing my ground and not letting the superintendent shirk responsibility. He kept saying it wasn\u2019t the school\u2019s event, so I kept pointing out that it didn\u2019t matter whose event it was, it\u2019s happening at the school, and he is in charge of the schools. I was relatively articulate and stood my ground, so that felt good.</p>\n\n<p>At this point, I\u2019m in too deep to just drop it. I think I actually told him that too, now that I think about it. So I\u2019m trying to get this all out there as much as I can. All but one of the board members are up for re-election on August 23rd. I haven\u2019t heard from any of them except for one email from one of them that she would follow up, and then nothing. So I sent my post to all their opponents in the election and told them that it might be a good opportunity to blast the incumbent for inaction. I feel like there\u2019s definitely traction, and a tiny possibility that MAYBE we can get something changed.</p>\n\n<p>This has been a really weird couple of days. It\u2019s been incredibly nerve-wracking, but also, it feels incredible! I highly recommend everybody tries getting involved. Everybody\u2019s comments and messages have really been so encouraging so thank you all for that.</p>\n\n<p>The superintendent is getting your calls and emails, so please keep it up, ESPECIALLY if there is anybody in here that lives in Okaloosa County! Academy Night is scheduled for Tuesday, so we have until then to get it canceled. Thanks Reddit!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<h1>Update 3:</h1>\n\n<p>This one will be brief - the event is still scheduled and Gaetz is still attending. Thanks to you guys though, we are getting national attention! <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/matt-gaetz-sparks-outrage-over-hosting-high-school-event-1734014\">Newsweek published this article this morning</a>, and I believe Vanity Fair should be publishing one shortly as well (I&#39;ll update the post with that link when it comes out). Thank you so so much to everyone that has participated in this discussion and for all of the many encouraging and helpful messages I have received from all over. I haven&#39;t gotten a chance to reply to all of them, but I truly appreciate them. Covid finally caught a hold of me, and I&#39;ve been laid up since the weekend, but I&#39;ve read them all.</p>\n\n<p>I keep telling myself that even if this event doesn&#39;t get cancelled, this post and the public outcry has brought some much-needed attention to the issue, and hopefully people that were all-in on voting for Gaetz are reconsidering their position.</p>\n\n<p>On a personal note, if you have thought about getting more involved and haven&#39;t because you don&#39;t feel like it will do any good - do it! It&#39;ll feel great!</p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>---------------------------------------------</p>\n\n<p>Edit to add <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/wkm5v9/comment/ijo94pj/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3\">Top comment</a> from OOP to help clear something up:</p>\n\n<p>This is fantastic and very well written.

I never cheated. I love my husband, we've been together since college and he's the love of my life, he's handsome and kind and while I've slept with two other people, both were before we got together. There is no other potential father for our daughter. We were married already and actively trying for a baby. I never cheated, I never would cheat, and I don't know why he took that stupid test because I would never, ever cheat, but it came back negative and now he thinks he's not her dad. I don't know how to convince him it was a faulty test and I'm so scared.\n\nThese past few months it's like he's become someone completely different from the man I married. He's cold, and suspicious. He kept demanding to see my phone, and wouldn't tell me why, and I showed him at first but eventually told him I wouldn't anymore unless he explained why. He's been distant with our daughter too. He stays in his office for hours on end, and I don't know what he's doing. I did not cheat. He accused me this morning, saying he'd done the test after realizing that our daughter's eyes (brown) wouldn't naturally come from ours (both blue) and that he wanted me to get out of the house. I didn't leave and he locked me out of our bedroom and now I'm in my daughter's room. This is terrifying.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nEdit: The specific advice I want is how I can prove I'm innocent and how to make sure this relationship works. I want to keep my family together at all costs.\n\nAlso, I just had a conversation with my husband. He's out of his room now, and we discussed some things. I told him again that I would never cheat and started talking about a list I made of tests I want done, but he told me that he didn't want to hear it right now. We're going to have a longer conversation tomorrow and he said that he still loves our daughter, and he won't try to keep me out of the house or our room for now. I asked him to hug me and he did. I'm scared that I won't be able to convince him. I just want our family to go back to normal. How can I be a good wife and support his needs while proving my innocence?\n\nTL;DR: My husband confronted me this morning saying our daughter isn't biologically his after a failed paternity test, but I never cheated.\n\n\n\n\n\n[UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/vp74i5/update_my_29f_husband_31m_got_a_paternity_test_on/)\n\n\nHi everyone. First off, I wanted to thank everyone who reached out, my original post got so much attention, it was hard to get to everything, but I ended up making a list of plans, and tests I wanted to get done. My husband was (understandably) distrustful of me for a while, but he apologized for the way he acted (which I didn't need) and said that he wouldn't try to kick me out of our home. He did say, though, that if every test came back and I'd cheated, then he was going to \"go scorched earth.\"\n\nWe did a few tests. Blood paternity tests for him and me, and our daughter, and we had an appointment with a chimerism specialist coming up, but that got canceled because, well, some of you guessed it, but my daughter is not biologically mine either. I don't know how this happened, but a police officer came to our house and took our statements, and we're suing the hospital where I gave birth. I don't know what happened to my baby, and that is terrifying. I have my husband back, but my whole world was still upended, and I just wish he'd never taken that stupid test. I've been sleeping in my daughter's room, and I'm so afraid that she's going to be taken away from me, but at the same time I want to know where my biological daughter is, and if she's okay. I pray to god she's okay.\n\nMy daughter still doesn't know the details, and we've been trying to keep this quiet. The last thing we need is a big scandal. I don't want people who know us to look at her differently. She deserves better than that, she's such a good kid, and she's not some spectacle to be gawked at. If we can find her birth family, I have no idea what we'll do. I guess the best case scenario would be to get a bigger house and all live together, but I don't know if we can afford that, or if they'd go for that, or even if we'll be able to locate them, or if I'm just crazy. This whole situation is crazy. I don't know anyone else who's been in a situation like this. I mean, are there support groups for parents of kids who got mixed up? I googled and nothing came up. Literally all I'm getting are tabloid articles from trashy magazines that slap the faces of innocent kids on the same pages as celebrity sex scandals, and fiction. How do we tell our daughter? I mean we can't tell her now, she'll tell the kids at school and then it'll be everywhere, but we have to say something.\n\nI don't know what I ever did to deserve this.\n\nTL;DR: My daughter is not biologically mine, or my husband's.\n\n\n[OOP is also asking LegalAdvice for help.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/vp90na/i_just_found_out_my_5_year_old_daughter_isnt_mine/)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[OOP's Husband's Perspective on Everything:](https://www.reddit.com/user/fullyfaithfulwife/comments/vsxs4k/my_husband_saw_my_post/)\n\n\n\n*Hello, everyone. So, apparently a youtuber my husband watches called Mark Narrations decided that it would be a fun idea to read my post on his channel. My husband recognized the story, because, well of course he recognized the story, how could he not? This doesn't happen every day. Then he went on my account page. Then he found quite a few comments about him that were not exactly... nice. And now, he has asked me for a chance to post his side of the story on this account, so that people stop trashing him. Please be nice.*\n\nSo, I don't know how many of you have been down a self doubt rabbithole before, but it's not the most logical place to be. It's even less logical when you have the whole damn internet telling you that your wife is cheating, and that she's planning to take the house, and take you for all you're worth, and never really loved you, and you always sorta thought she was too good for you anyway, so you end up seeing everything as a sign of infidelity, and then you get not one, but two failed paternity tests on your daughter. When Covid happened, I got fat. I got depressed. I stopped feeling like a person. My wife stayed beautiful. She stayed herself. I was sure that she'd made a mistake. That she'd regret being with me. I started getting into some online groups, especially on reddit, that were full of guys who'd been cheated on, lost custody, lost everything, and when someone said that his tipoff was that he and his wife both had blue eyes and their son had brown, I felt fucking stupid. I did not want to jump to conclusions, but when I made a post about my fears, everyone said that she was cheating. People said not to say anything, because she'd use it to hide her cheating and get ahead of me on the divorce. I got the test and I didn't really think it'd come back negative. Then it did. I didn't want to believe it, but yeah, I pulled back. I felt betrayed. I wanted to be a good husband but I couldn't shake this. I tried to find evidence of an affair, and failed. I got another test. When that one was also negative, I snapped. If you've ever been cheated on, you know what it feels like. When my wife denied it, I got angrier. I just wanted her to leave. I didn't want to go through what everyone seemed to think was going to happen. I didn't want to lose custody of my kid. I didn't want to lose my house. I was scared, and angry, and I wanted the truth. I felt like if she couldn't even be honest there was no getting past this. I took a few hours to calm down. When she came back with a list of tests to take, I tried to keep my cool. I tried to keep my cool for so long. I know I was wrong about the affair, but so was everyone else in my ear. My kid is genuinely not biologically mine. I didn't immediately consider that switched at birth was an option. I've been through a messed up time, and I don't think getting angry one time because I thought my wife cheated and was lying about it makes me a monster.\n\n*Hi, it's Fullyfaithfulwife here again! I just want to say that 1. I agree that he's not a monster, an abuser, or anything of the sort. 2. I do not agree that he's fat. I love this man very much and have for ages, and we are not going to let this situation break our marriage. Thank you to everyone for all your help.*",

I'm 14M, I'm American but live in Asia, being vauge because I don't want this traced back to me if the situation is as bad as it seems.\n\nI don't know if I should give some sort of background or anything, but up until about 7 months ago, I lived with my Mom (39) and my dad (41) plus my little sister(9). I say was because my sister is no longer here, she's in \"boarding school\".\n\nI want to preface this by saying we are not bad kids, we're half white, half Asian, when my grandpa (in dads side) got sick 4 years ago we moved here so my dad can take care of him. Me and my sister worked hard to learn the language, despite her age, she actually caught on better than me and I was so impressed with her.\n\nThe issue began with grandma, she would really look down on my sister and I love my sister and didn't like it one bit. My mom said its cultural and I shouldn't make a fuss but it was hard when grandma really started making it obvious, she got me clothes, games, etc, but my sis got no attention.

Its been a crazy few weeks but I absolutely needed to update as soon as possible. Sorry my post got locked ans I appreciate everyone who spoke to me via DMs, sorry to those I couldn't get to- it was a lot.\n\nI should get on with the most important of the update, what I finally ended up doing. So thanks to the super community that is reddit, I was able to get in touch with a few different sources, the least favorite of which was a phone call towards those that help find trafficked children. I knew my family would be investigated and actually went to meet up with another family in that time, so basically, a redditor close to my age, who I'll keep private, met with me and she had already showed my story to her family.\n\nThey ended up letting me stay with them for a bit and made the proper calls to make sure it wasn't illegal, I actually even specified that I wasn't running from home, and I'd come back after the investigation. It didn't sit so well with authorities and I was actually forced to go back home, but it only got stranger from there.\n\nI went back home to a completely empty house, even Grandma was gone, so I was allowed to stay with the other family for the time being. They were extremely kind, for a week I didn't get any news and, bless her mother's heart but I was told I had a home here no matter the results. So, a few days after a week had passed, I get a call and it turns out they found my sister!\n\nMy family had been taken in for questioning and were placed in holding for quite a while, I'm not sure why they didn't tell me this immediately though. I don't actually know the full story, but my sister was living close 700 Kilometers away, yeah, nearly a whole days drive, it wasn't summer school, or boarding school, or anything like that- My Dad sold her to get married.\n\nMy mom was off the hook as 1, I still needed a parent, and 2, she wasn't in on it until it was a decent way in. My dad and grandma have been arrested though and I'm back living with my mom and sister now. I'm still in contact with rhe redditor that let me stay with her and I'll forever be greatful, I have no idea what would have happened if I was around when authorities came knocking. She's my angel!\n\nOn a more depressing note, my sister doesn't speak much, but she seemed to cheer up after I let her read my post. She said she felt abandoned and alone, among other things, but seeing how I and plenty of strangers gave their hearts for her made her very happy so thank you all.\n\nSorry for being ao vauge here but I'm trying to protect identities. This isn't over by a long shot, there's still things that are going to happen, but I have my sister, and that's all thanks to reddit. Thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*Reminder - I am not the original poster.\\*\\*\n\nOP note: I'm marking this concluded for now because they got her back",

AMAA](https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/3r7oeh/i_am_bisfitty_the_period_appropriate_corporate/) \n\n* **[OP Provides proof of his identity while in costume](http://imgur.com/BLk363N)**\n\n* **[OP Provides photo updates of him and his wife at the corporate function in period-appropriate attire](http://imgur.com/gallery/l9Qzn)**\n\nHi, I'm /u/bisfitty\n, the most deliveringest OP in history. As a lot of you already know, I had to attend a \"corporate retreat\" this weekend, that happened to take place on a southern plantation in Alabama. There was a \"period appropriate\" costume ball scheduled for the end of the trip, but they apparently forgot about me, their lone black employee. Hilarity ensued.\n\n**UPDATE:** Currently on the phone with boss and HR... Was wondering why the call wasn't with boss and the HR chick I deal with all the time... I now know why I am dealing with the HEAD of HR, and not the usual chick, lol Normal HR chick is the person I expected to hear from. Wasn't her because **THE DAMN PARTY WAS HER DUMBASS IDEA!** She has been canned, I have been promoted, with a disproportionate raise, and better bennies benefits, but I have been ASSURED that this has nothing to do with anything that happened on the retreat, and just happens to be coinciding with HRAsstDir canning. So remember kids, correlation =/= causation!\n\n**Additional info from the comments:**\n\n> **Commenter**- Anything you planned for the party that you missed out on? I would have paid to see you surprise a Confederate officer. Funniest/most clever thing I've seen on Reddit yet. Well done.\n> \n\n\n* **OOP**- That would be it. There was a super old couple, New England transplants from the south, who came with Confederate Officer uniforms, and were really proud of them. They kept talking it up, and were probably the most excited, out of everyone in attendance, about the ball. After my reveal with the chick in the dress, they avoided me like the plague (the black one) and their uniforms were never seen.\n\n\n\n> **Commenter**- How did the idea pop in your head?

As a lot of you already know, I had to attend a &quot;corporate retreat&quot; this weekend, that happened to take place on a southern plantation in Alabama. There was a &quot;period appropriate&quot; costume ball scheduled for the end of the trip, but they apparently forgot about me, their lone black employee. Hilarity ensued.</p>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Currently on the phone with boss and HR... Was wondering why the call wasn&#39;t with boss and the HR chick I deal with all the time... I now know why I am dealing with the HEAD of HR, and not the usual chick, lol Normal HR chick is the person I expected to hear from. Wasn&#39;t her because <strong>THE DAMN PARTY WAS HER DUMBASS IDEA!</strong> She has been canned, I have been promoted, with a disproportionate raise, and better bennies benefits, but I have been ASSURED that this has nothing to do with anything that happened on the retreat, and just happens to be coinciding with HRAsstDir canning. So remember kids, correlation =/= causation!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Additional info from the comments:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commenter</strong>- Anything you planned for the party that you missed out on? I would have paid to see you surprise a Confederate officer. Funniest/most clever thing I&#39;ve seen on Reddit yet. Well done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>OOP</strong>- That would be it. There was a super old couple, New England transplants from the south, who came with Confederate Officer uniforms, and were really proud of them. They kept talking it up, and were probably the most excited, out of everyone in attendance, about the ball. After my reveal with the chick in the dress, they avoided me like the plague (the black one) and their uniforms were never seen.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Commenter</strong>- How did the idea pop in your head?

It was done in a park. She didn't want to report it and went into a full breakdown, wouldn't speak to police, go to hospital etc. I couldn't force her, so I just stayed with her.\n\nShe was, obviously, in a really shit state since, and I've been with her, by her side, listening to her, helping her. We went to therapy, and she knows I'm there for her. She has a history of depression, and I've been really worried.\n\nLast week, we found out she was pregnant. I was abroad for 2 months before the rape on work, and can back early to care for her. So the baby definitely isn't mine. She is 100% sure it's the rapist's.\n\nSo we had a discussion. She is a devout Catholic. We initially decided on a abortion, but after she speak to her Mother, she has decided to keep the baby, saying that isn't the baby's fault.\n\nI flat out told her that I would not help raise a baby of a guy who raped her. She cried and begged me not to leave. I told she is the one making the choice - either she keeps the baby and I leave, or she aborts the baby and I stay. I would not let this go.\n\nShe didn't want either of those things to happen, so I told her we were done...\n\nI feel shit. Was i wrong?\n\n[Update 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/blird0/update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'll post the update first, since there has been some change since I last posted. Then I'll respond to some general points made from the last thread, and the ton of PMs I received.\n\nYesterday, I received a call from my GF. She was crying, and she begged me to listen to her. I told her that I still care for her, and that I'll obviously listen to what she has to say.\n\nShe told me that a few days after I told her we were done, she called up her Mother to talk about this. Apparently, what happened before was that she was pretty much decided on aborting, but then when she spoke to her Mother, her mother told her that under no accounts should she abort, and that I was actually manipulating her to do so. Her Mother went on to say that if she aborted the child, she would no longer consider my gf as her daughter.\n\nAfter I left her, my gf called her Mum up to talk about what went on. My GF said that she desperately wanted to abort the baby, and her Mother again said that if she does so, this is the last time they will ever speak again. My GF said she broke down on the phone, and her Mother kept asking her what she will do. The conversation then ended when my GF said she didn't know.\n\nThen she started texting. After a few hours of thinking, my GF sent her mum a text saying she was going to abort. She was then blocked.\n\nMy GF then called me, and told me everything.\n\nShe will be having an abortion in 3 weeks.\n\nI discussed this with my GF, and we both completely agreed that I had not manipulated her in any way, and that she appreciated that I put my foot down, because had I not, she would have had a baby who would remind her of the worst time of her life. (Her words, not mine)\n\nShe further went on to say that I am the best thing that has ever happened to her, and that she knew that even if she no longer had a Mum, if she had me, she could get through this. I broke down at this point.\n\nI love her so much. In truth, I probably would have gone back to her and raised the baby with her, even though I knew I'd resent it. I made the original thread to get some backing rather than anything, to see if I had made the right decision.\n\nI'm so relieved things had turned out the way they have.\n\nAlso, screw any Mother who places religion over their own child. Friggin lunatics.\n\nNow to respond to some of your points from the last thread:\n\n1: No. My GF did not cheat on me. I am almost certain about this. Not only because she had the conscience of a fragile angel, but also because we both know each others' schedules really well, and we often talk to friends who can corroborate timings. Moreover, her roommate took photos of my GF after she came home assaulted. It's not \"rough sex\" as some of you dicks put it.\n\n2: I don't give a rat's arse if you think abortion is a sin or the killing of a baby. Come and raise the baby or give us money to raise the baby or hire us a live in maid to tend to my GFs every need while she pregnant if you're so sanctimonious. Talk the talk, then walk the walk you wanking tit-baboons.\n\n3: My GF was absolutely clear she wanted to raise the baby (probably influenced by the Mum).\n\n4: Thanks for all the people telling me I did the right thing. It was really difficult. I'm very glad it turned out the way it has though.\n\n5: To the people who PM'd me telling me I'm a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.\n\nThanks Reddit.\n\n\n[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but I thought I should provide an update on some recent events from a Mother from the pits of Satan's rectum.\n\nOn Saturday, I answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. They asked me if I was who I was, and I replied I was. They then said they were looking for my GF. I called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.\n\nThe officers then split, one taking the GF to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.\n\nThe officer who took me started asking me questions about how long GF had been here. If she had any contact with anyone else. If she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. I answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on GF. I asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn't say.\n\nAfter a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. The moment they left, my GF told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if I had been hurting her. She was also asked if she was being held against her will. She said no to everything, of course. She said that the police received a call from her Mother saying she might be in danger, and that I could be abusive her.\n\nI was fucking livid. I immediately said I was going to press charges against her - for what? I dunno. Harrassment probably?\n\nMy GF begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to \"calm down\".\n\nWtf? She sent police to my house to get me arrested. How is that sane thinking? I could lose my job if I was arrested and charged. What the hell is she thinking?\n\nI told GF that if the Mother does anything like this again, I will definitely press charges. So the GF decides on Sunday to talk to the Mum to not do anything like this again.\n\nThey had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then I start hearing sobs. Immediately, I walked into the room, saw my GF was crying, still holding the phone against her ear.\n\nI plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as I heard \"hello?\" From the phone. Then I put it on me, and said \"you're a disgrace of a Mother\" and hung up.\n\nThen I held the GF for what felt like an hour before we started talking.\n\nApparently, the Mother was telling GF how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the Mother again, or her brother, or her deceased Father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat GF, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because GF would be going to damnation.\n\nI told GF that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we'd be nice and toasty together. I love her smile.\n\nWhat do you think, if anything, should I do about the Mother? No doubt my words to her will have some reactions.\n\nResponse to some people from previous threads and PMs after thread was locked:\n\n1 - Abortion was never an option. GF was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her Mother. And if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.\n\n2 - You can believe my GF cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, I suppose. Just FYI, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. Cheating...right........\n\nEdit: 3 - My GF and I are still going to therapy about all of this.\n\n[Update 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bwxccc/final_update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.\n\nA few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she's clear!).\n\nShe went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.\n\nThey went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.\n\nWhen she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.\n\nWe took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.\n\nShe's amazing, man. Seriously.\n\nUpdate on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.\n\nMy GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn't know what to say, and gave it to me.\n\nI told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said \"How Jesus of you\" at which point she hung up.\n\nMy GF didn't find it funny...\n\nAnyway, that's it.\n\nGood luck to everyone in their lives.\n\nAlso, if you're going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I've killed\u00a0a\u00a0baby\u00a0before.",

I&#39;m very glad it turned out the way it has though.</p>\n\n<p>5: To the people who PM&#39;d me telling me I&#39;m a monstrous baby killer - I fail to see what my hobbies have to do with this issue.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks Reddit.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/boai5u/update2_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant_i/\">Update 2</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I was hoping to post here again after the abortion (still scheduled for two weeks time), but I thought I should provide an update on some recent events from a Mother from the pits of Satan&#39;s rectum.</p>\n\n<p>On Saturday, I answered my door and stood face to face with two police officers. They asked me if I was who I was, and I replied I was. They then said they were looking for my GF. I called her over, and the police officer said that he needs to have a word with her.</p>\n\n<p>The officers then split, one taking the GF to the living room (we let them in) and the other took me into my bedroom.</p>\n\n<p>The officer who took me started asking me questions about how long GF had been here. If she had any contact with anyone else. If she had left the house at all...and a few other questions. I answered, and then asked what this was about, but the officer just said they received a report to check in on GF. I asked who reported, and the officer said he couldn&#39;t say.</p>\n\n<p>After a while, the other officer was done, and they both left. The moment they left, my GF told me that she was outrightly asked if she was in danger, and if I had been hurting her. She was also asked if she was being held against her will. She said no to everything, of course. She said that the police received a call from her Mother saying she might be in danger, and that I could be abusive her.</p>\n\n<p>I was fucking livid. I immediately said I was going to press charges against her - for what? I dunno. Harrassment probably?</p>\n\n<p>My GF begged me to not, and said that it would all just blow over, and that she just needs time to &quot;calm down&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>Wtf? She sent police to my house to get me arrested. How is that sane thinking? I could lose my job if I was arrested and charged. What the hell is she thinking?</p>\n\n<p>I told GF that if the Mother does anything like this again, I will definitely press charges. So the GF decides on Sunday to talk to the Mum to not do anything like this again.</p>\n\n<p>They had a conversation for about 2 minutes, then I start hearing sobs. Immediately, I walked into the room, saw my GF was crying, still holding the phone against her ear.</p>\n\n<p>I plucked he phone from her hand, and held her for a bit as I heard &quot;hello?&quot; From the phone. Then I put it on me, and said &quot;you&#39;re a disgrace of a Mother&quot; and hung up.</p>\n\n<p>Then I held the GF for what felt like an hour before we started talking.</p>\n\n<p>Apparently, the Mother was telling GF how if she continues with the abortion, she will never see the Mother again, or her brother, or her deceased Father (who is in heaven, even though he died a drink violent alcoholic who beat GF, but hey, repent your sins at death, amiright?) because GF would be going to damnation.</p>\n\n<p>I told GF that if she was going to hell, then she should save me a seat, and we&#39;d be nice and toasty together. I love her smile.</p>\n\n<p>What do you think, if anything, should I do about the Mother? No doubt my words to her will have some reactions.</p>\n\n<p>Response to some people from previous threads and PMs after thread was locked:</p>\n\n<p>1 - Abortion was never an option. GF was adamant she wanted to raise the baby, influenced by her Mother. And if you suggest adoption anyway, then you truly do not understand just how taxing a normal pregnancy is, let alone one dipped in a beautiful cocktail of rape depression.</p>\n\n<p>2 - You can believe my GF cheated on me if that makes you feel better about your lives, I suppose. Just FYI, the pictures and roommates report showed she had a bloodied nose, black eyes, cuts and bruises against her arms, hands and knees, torn coat and top, bruises around her neck. Cheating...right........</p>\n\n<p>Edit: 3 - My GF and I are still going to therapy about all of this.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/bwxccc/final_update_my_gf_was_raped_and_became_pregnant/\">Update 3</a></p>\n\n<p>&#x200B;</p>\n\n<p>I just wanted to update folk on this whole saga. This will be my final update.</p>\n\n<p>A few days ago, the abortion was carried out. During the weeks beforehand, my GF went to a counsellor and talked to a nurse about why she wanted an abortion. She was also tested for any STIs (she&#39;s clear!).</p>\n\n<p>She went ahead with the abortion after getting the all clear. A few days ago it was successfully carried out.</p>\n\n<p>They went for the surgical abortion method, which involved using a vacuum to suck the pregnancy out. GF said it was pretty painless, and she was able to return home after just a few hours.</p>\n\n<p>When she came home, she cried and cried and cried. She says she feels like a huge weight had been lifted, and she can finally look to moving on with her life.</p>\n\n<p>We took the whole week of work, and yesterday we went camping (it rained). While in the tent, she talked about how difficult life was sometimes, but she was really glad things turned out the way they did, because even though things were bad, she came out the other side, probably stronger than before.</p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s amazing, man. Seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Update on the Mum! So my GF received a call from her Mum, who was asking if she went through with the abortion.</p>\n\n<p>My GF and I have an agreement that if Mum calls, either hang up or give it to me. In this instance, she answered, didn&#39;t know what to say, and gave it to me.</p>\n\n<p>I told the Mum that the abortion went perfectly, and smiled as she cursed at me for about a minute. I then said &quot;How Jesus of you&quot; at which point she hung up.</p>\n\n<p>My GF didn&#39;t find it funny...</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, that&#39;s it.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck to everyone in their lives.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you&#39;re going to message and insult me via PM, just be warned: I&#39;ve killed\u00a0a\u00a0baby\u00a0before.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

Parents did not take the marriage as well as I'd hoped and ignored me for 5 years, only to reach out when they saw a 5th anniversary facebook post that mentioned our kids. Do I let them back in, or do I ignore them?\n\nMy husband (30m) used to be my boss. About 9 years ago I started working as his assistant. We spent about 2.5 years ignoring our mutual attraction until we gave in. We then went to HR, who reassigned me, and the whole thing was strictly above board from the time we began dating. I got pregnant about a year later, and my husband and I decided to just get married. While we'd only really been dating for about 1.5 years, we knew each other completely, loved each other, lived together, and there was a baby on the way. We knew how it would look, but I had to leave the company anyway due to problems with my new boss, so we didn't anticipate this causing any issues, except with my parents.\n\nThey (62m/57f) have always been overprotective, so I knew they wouldn't like me dating my boss, and hadn't told them, but I had to tell them if I wanted them at my wedding. We decided to be mostly honest with them, about how it was strictly professional until it wasn't, how the second it got unprofessional we went to HR, how he had never taken advantage of me, but now we wanted to get married and we wanted them there. We did not mention the baby, because I felt that giving them that information in addition to the rest all at once would just break them. I was only about 4 months along when the wedding happened, so the bump was easily hidden by a flowy dress.\n\nThe wedding itself went off without a hitch, and apart from my mother pulling me into the bathroom shortly before the ceremony to ask if I was sure about this, which I said I was, my parents seemed to take it well. The ceremony and reception were at 2 different venues, and we had to travel from one to the other, and my parents never arrived at the reception. I called them and got ignored, and then my brother called them and they told him that they were going home. I don't remember the exact reason they gave but it amounted to them being tired and uncomfortable. I tried contacting them after the wedding, but found that I was blocked on everything except email, which I used to send them a long letter essentially saying that I'm an adult who made an adult choice and I hope they can respect that.\n\n5 years later, I have not heard from my parents since my wedding. My husband and I are not big on social media in general but I recently posted something for our 5th anniversary in which I mentioned our 2 kids and third on the way. Within a month of making this post, my parents left a voicemail saying they saw the post, and, having had no idea that they had grandchildren previously, now want to meet them. I haven't responded and there have been a few follow ups since then asking why I haven't.\n\nI don't know what to do, but my gut instinct is that 5 years is too long, and it's about the kids, not about them respecting my choices or relationship. However, I can't help but feel that I'm being unfair, and my brother agrees, because I told them in my email that if they could learn to respect my choice and my marriage eventually, then we could talk, and now I'm retroactively applying a time limit.\n\nEdit: can't find a way to work this in organically but my husband is not white. I am, as are my parents. I don't think this is a race thing or that my parents are racist, and neither does my husband, and we don't understand why they would want to meet our mixed race children if they were racist, but this element is still gnawing at me.\n\nShould I reach out to them? If I did, how would we go about rebuilding the relationship?\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[**Update**](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/qdfsx0/update_i_29f_spoke_to_my_parents_who_ghosted_me_5/) _- October 22, 2021_\n\nTLDR; They're racists.\n\nI asked to talk yesterday. We were on zoom within an hour. It was my parents and me and my husband. They asked to see the kids, and I said they could see them eventually, dependant on them earning our trust and convincing us they were going to be positive additions to the kids' lives.\n\nThey asked to start by reading me a letter that they claimed to have written on my wedding day. It said that they were uncomfortable with me marrying my former boss as they thought he took advantage of me, so they left between the wedding and reception to avoid a scene, but they wanted me to know they were here for me despite their issues with him. They added that they would have sent this to me the morning after my wedding, but then I sent my email about them needing to respect my choices, and they were so ashamed they couldn't bring themselves to send theirs. Seeing my anniversary post made them realise how much they've missed in 5 years and they really don't want to miss any more.\n\nI had some questions, like what the big deal was with me marrying my former boss, and they said that it just wasn't what they had in mind for my wedding day and my future spouse. I asked why they even came to the wedding at all if they didn't support the marriage, and my dad responded that he wanted to walk his daughter down the aisle as it was the only chance he'd get. The way it was phrased implied that they had intentionally only come to the wedding so he could give me away, and always planned to leave halfway, and because he said \"my daughter\", and didn't talk to me directly, it was pretty clear he was thinking about my older sister, who passed away. My husband caught that, too, and said that if they were talking about me, they should address me directly, then added that if they had planned to leave they should have told us as we wouldn't have invited them, and the fact they waited 5 years to reach out was going to take more reasons than shame as, as a father, he didn't understand how they could ignore their daughter for years, or only get back in touch when we had kids.\n\nMy dad snapped that he wasn't going to take this from a \"cushi\", a slur meaning dark skinned. My mother immediately tried to run damage control but I ended the call. They have since messaged me several times trying to explain that calling my husband a racial slur wasn't indicative of a racist attitude, and he wouldn't have said that in front of the kids, so they should still get to meet them.\n\nI've spent 5 years wondering how they were so offended by me marrying my boss that it earned no contact for half a decade. Turns out they're just racist. It's almost nice to find out. If it was just the boss thing I would have sympathy for them and we might even be able to reconcile, but with this, it's now just a question of if I'm going to knowingly expose my mixed race children to a couple of racists, which I am obviously not going to do.",

The mother got upset and demanded I pay for it.\n\nWell she(mother) and son showed up at my door around noon and apologized. She said that she misunderstood what happened and thought that I\u2019d done it on purpose to teach her son a lesson about leaving his stuff in my yard. I guess he explained to her it was his fault which I thought was commendable for someone his age. She told me that she just stressed about it because she is a single mother and doesn\u2019t really have the means to replace it at the moment and that if it was anything else she probably wouldn\u2019t have gotten so upset but he likes hanging out with other kids and that\u2019s how she keeps track of him.\n\nI told her about my spare phone (iPhone 7 his was a 6s). I also took the advice of some of the commenters that it might be damaging to just give it to him and that I should perhaps have him work for it. I have a detached garage and have been needing to clean it and told her if he wanted to help me I\u2019d give him the phone.\n\nHe instantly looked excited, I imagine he felt like he\u2019d never get a new phone, and she acted very grateful and said he could help.\n\nLeft and came back an hour later, just the son this time and we got started cleaning. Took about 4 hours, a lot of work but nothing too hard (he's just 12)\n\nI had a couple cords of firewood I wanted moved out and stacked into a rack and then a bunch of boxes I cut up and had him bag and carry to the curb, he swept, had a coke and a couple slices of pizza then got his phone.\n\nI had a talk with him about paying attention to his where his things are because it won\u2019t always work out like this.\n\nI also told him if he wants to mow my yard every weekend and his mom says he can I\u2019ll pay him $30 a week. (It will probably take him a couple hours) \n\nHe again acted excited at the thought of making money and when I asked him what he\u2019d spend it on he said games. We figured out new games would be about $60 and worked it out that I\u2019d pay him $20 for 3 weeks then $65 on the fourth week so he could cover tax because it might be hard for him to save. The fourth week he will do an extra little chore to cover the five bucks, like sweep off the porch or walkway.\n\nI hope I\u2019ve done the right thing and didn\u2019t make him think that everything just works out but I did my best to have him earn it. And hopefully showed an equal measure of kindness that he will carry with him. I also didn\u2019t want the mother to stress over replacing the phone as my mom was also a single mother and I know how tough it can be. My own son is just 2 so it was my first real opportunity to pass on some fatherly wisdom, which I hope is what I did.\n\nThanks for your input everyone. I really appreciate it.",

I told the judge I gave her three options to choose from. 1) either to write her a check for a brand new one which was 2200 dollars. 2) Get her a refurbished one from apple or a third party or even used which would be around 1400 dollars or 3) fix her current MacBook since the screen is the only thing affected here and it would cost around 300 dollars plus money for labor.

I also told him that when I offered at the very beginning to get her a new one from the apple store she said no I want the money in cash. When I told her I\u2019d give her 2200 for a new one she said okay but later came asking for 2700 because she wants to upgrade.

I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. \n\nI think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. \n\nI know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as\u2026 well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would\u2026 \n\nThe first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. \n\nI decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. \n\nI decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.\n\nAfter 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again. Knowing he was an ENT I know it wont be his forte but he is a doctor.

I started typing it up in Word yesterday before my date and forgot about it before finishing it today. </p>\n\n<p>I think my boyfriend has been secretly drugging me for a while now and is gas lighting me. I know this is going to be hard to explain, but I have been having gaps in memory that I have been explaining away as being tired, or overworked, or whatever else.  I was going to ask my boyfriend about it, since he is a doctor, but then I started to notice that this seems to happen when I go on dates with him. </p>\n\n<p>I know it must be crazy, but I have woken up with dried semen on my breasts several times with no memory of the night before.  I know its him as\u2026 well I wont get into specifics but he likes that kind of thing more than other guys would\u2026 </p>\n\n<p>The first time it happened was when we were drinking and I wrote it off as too much to drink. We get drunk and have sex all the time so its not a big deal to me. But then there were a few times when I KNOW we were not drinking. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to break up with him over it only to suddenly find myself on a date with him a few days later. I had not yet had the conversation to break up with him, but planned on it next time I talked with him. I remember being at the restaurant, but nothing before that. My car and his car was in the parking lot too so I was confused. </p>\n\n<p>I decided to play along when he asked me to come back to his place.</p>\n\n<p>After 3 days at his place I remembered everything so I was started to trust him again.

Unfortunately, time is of the essence and this is likely to affect the majority of our community here let alone across the entirety of reddit.\n\n# What's happening?\n\n**API Pricing Changes**\n\n[Reddit recently announced major pricing changes to their API](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/), which is the software interface that all major 3rd party applications and bots rely upon to function. **These pricing changes are so extreme that all major apps will be forced to cease operating as they cannot bear the costs.** As an example, the developer of [Apollo](https://apolloapp.io) revealed they would be forced to pay reddit upwards of **$20 million USD/year** just to continue operating under the new pricing scheme. \n\nThe consensus from the developers behind these apps is that reddit is trying to price them out of existence in order to force users to switch to the official reddit mobile app. Not only will they be forced to pay ridiculous sums (which they cannot cover) to maintain access to the API, changes to the ToS also prohibit these apps from using ad revenue to offset the new costs. \n\nYou can find some of their statements below:\n\n* [Apollo](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/)\n* [Reddit is Fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditisfun/comments/13wxepd/rif_dev_here_reddits_api_changes_will_likely_kill/)\n* [Relay](https://www.reddit.com/r/RelayForReddit/comments/13wsn92/guess_this_is_also_the_death_of_relay/jmdthr4/)\n* [Narwhal](https://www.reddit.com/r/getnarwhal/comments/13wv038/reddit_have_quoted_the_apollo_devs_a_ridiculous/jmdqtyt/)\n* [BaconReader](https://www.reddit.com/r/baconreader/comments/13wveb2/reddit_api_changes_and_baconreader/)\n* [Sync](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsync/comments/12qwwjh/an_update_regarding_reddits_api_changes_to_how/jguy0oc/)\n\n**NSFW & Mature Content**\n\nIn addition to restricting API access behind a ludicrous pricing scheme, reddit is also planning on severely restricting 3rd party applications' access to NSFW/mature content. This will not only make the job of moderating NSFW communities significantly harder for humans, but also largely cripple 3rd party moderation bots that rely on being able to view NSFW content across multiple subreddits. Without the functions these bots provide, reddit is creating massive vulnerabilities in the areas of anti-spam and user safety.\n\nAs an example, some communities which focus on serving underage users may use 3rd party bots to automatically detect and remove accounts with a history of posting NSFW/mature content. Additionally there are other 3rd party bots that use comment history to proactively seek out and remove NSFW spam or even help detect and remove possible revenge porn or illegal underage content.\n\n# How will this affect me?\n\nAny users who rely on 3rd party applications (like those above) to browse reddit will find that **the apps will cease to function after July 1st**, when the pricing change goes into effect.\n\nIn addition, NSFW communities will likely see a large uptick in spam and potentially illegal/harmful content. It's possible that many of these communities will be forced to close if the human moderators responsible for them feel they can no longer keep their community safe without the proper tools these bots and 3rd party apps provide. Even subreddits like ours have to deal with a steady influx of NSFW spam, so these changes could have ramifications for the entire site.\n\nWhile it has never been explicitly stated by reddit, there is also a large concern that this move to consolidate mobile users to the official app could be a sign that they are planning to fully deprecate the old version of their desktop site (old.reddit.com) in order to consolidate users on the redesign as well.\n\n# What can we do to stop this?\n\nModerators from hundreds of communities across reddit have drafted and signed an open letter to reddit, asking them to reconsider the pricing scheme and to recognize the role that 3rd party apps have played in reddit's ongoing success. You can read the open letter here:\n\n* [/r/ModCoord: An open letter on the state of affairs regarding the API pricing and third party apps and how that will impact moderators and communities.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/)\n\nShould the open letter fall on deaf ears, many communities are also preparing subreddit blackouts in protest. This type of protest [has been used to great effect in the past](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/03/419756207/parts-of-social-sharing-site-reddit-go-dark-in-apparent-user-revolt), however it is also highly disruptive to the communities participating.\n\nAs the mod team for this great community ^(btw), our primary goal is to make sure we are serving you all to the best of our ability. We feel strongly that this is a worthy cause and that the outcome will have a massive effect on the future viability and success of the entire platform. We want to join the 500+ communities that have already committed to this action and demonstrate that our community answers the call in times of need.\n\n**However, we won't do it without you.** The decision to blackout the subreddit should not be made by the mod team alone. Please share your thoughts, ask your questions, and let us know if you feel this is something we should be a part of. The mod team will do our best to answer any questions we can and we promise that any action we take (or don't) will be based on the will of our ~~star~~ community.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nThe /r/ffxiv mod team",

I wrote this a couple days ago but couldn\u2019t post it because it was too soon. \n\nMy husband came home at around 6 o\u2019clock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk. \n\nI sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didn\u2019t know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post. \n\nWhen he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything. \n\nHe told me that the world was in a \u201cshitty place\u201d right now, and that we\u2019re bringing a child into a stressful time. \n\nHe said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility. \n\nHe said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he \u201cdoubled down\u201d he could get through it. But the more he tried the \u201cdarker the tunnel got\u201d and eventually he couldn\u2019t see an end. \n\nHe said that he feels like he\u2019s \u201cconstantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.\u201d\n\nHe said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesn\u2019t tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said \u201cthis was for when it happens.\u201d\n\nI asked him why he couldn\u2019t tell me any of this, and he said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cburden me with the truth.\u201d\n\nHe said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a \u201cprotecter and provider\u201d, and that I would inevitably stop loving him. \n\nHearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didn\u2019t know where he got the notion I would feel that way. \n\nI asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesn\u2019t bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. It\u2019s just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way. \n\nHe said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more. \n\nI told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that he\u2019d feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that he\u2019ll only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses. \n\nOnce things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandma\u2019s house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married. \n\nHe also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so that\u2019s the plan. I\u2019ll call his boss tomorrow and say that he\u2019s sick and can\u2019t come in, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll make a sick man come in to work. There\u2019s a pandemic going on :). \n\nRight now he\u2019s playing with the kids and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.\n\nFor the first time in months I don\u2019t see the robot, I see my husband.\n\nEdit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things. \n\nFirst things first, my husband says hi. \n\n1.  I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know it\u2019s my responsibility. My husband\u2019s only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other \u201chouse maintenance\u201d stuff. \n\n2. I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasn\u2019t a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better. \n\n3. The pregnancy wasn\u2019t an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a \u201cif it happens it happens\u201d kind of thing. We\u2019re both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption. \n\n4. We realize that a one week vacation isn\u2019t enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way.

I wrote this a couple days ago but couldn\u2019t post it because it was too soon. </p>\n\n<p>My husband came home at around 6 o\u2019clock, and after he had something to eat I took him to the bedroom to talk. </p>\n\n<p>I sat him down on the bed and told him I was worried about him. I didn\u2019t know exactly how to phrase my worries so I just showed him my original post. </p>\n\n<p>When he finished reading the post he starting crying, like full on crying. In all the years that I have known this man, I had never seen a tear roll down his eye. I held him for a few minutes until he could recompose himself, and he told me everything. </p>\n\n<p>He told me that the world was in a \u201cshitty place\u201d right now, and that we\u2019re bringing a child into a stressful time. </p>\n\n<p>He said when I became pregnant he felt he had to step up. He needed to take care of things because it was his responsibility. </p>\n\n<p>He said that the weight of carrying the family was so much harder than he anticipated so he thought if he \u201cdoubled down\u201d he could get through it. But the more he tried the \u201cdarker the tunnel got\u201d and eventually he couldn\u2019t see an end. </p>\n\n<p>He said that he feels like he\u2019s \u201cconstantly drowning, and the only breath of fresh air is on the car ride between home and work.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He said that sometimes the stress is so much that he throws up, but doesn\u2019t tell anyone and instead keeps going with his day. He then pulled out a pack of gum from his pocket and said \u201cthis was for when it happens.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>I asked him why he couldn\u2019t tell me any of this, and he said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cburden me with the truth.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>He said that, he thought if he told me everything, that I would stop seeing him as a \u201cprotecter and provider\u201d, and that I would inevitably stop loving him. </p>\n\n<p>Hearing him say that brought tears to my eyes because I didn\u2019t know where he got the notion I would feel that way. </p>\n\n<p>I asked him if he wanted to quit his job but surprisingly he said the job doesn\u2019t bother him. He said the work in of it self was fine. It\u2019s just now he feels an added weight to provide because not only was he fortunate enough to keep his job in the pandemic, but we also had a kid on the way. </p>\n\n<p>He said that some days he feels like packing a suit case and running to some tropical island for a week and not telling anyone. But then he feels guilty and doubles down even more. </p>\n\n<p>I told him that maybe he should go on a trip. I said that he deserved a break, and maybe if he did exactly that he\u2019d feel better. He tried to protest, but I insisted. In the end said that he\u2019ll only go, if we go together. Like a romantic get away between spouses. </p>\n\n<p>Once things start to clear up and before the baby is due, he wants to take a week off from work, drop the kids off at Grandma\u2019s house and have us go on a vacation. Just the two of us, like we used to when we first got married. </p>\n\n<p>He also said he wants to take the day off tomorrow and just sleep in, so that\u2019s the plan. I\u2019ll call his boss tomorrow and say that he\u2019s sick and can\u2019t come in, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll make a sick man come in to work. There\u2019s a pandemic going on :). </p>\n\n<p>Right now he\u2019s playing with the kids and it doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s doing one of his chores. He actually seems to be enjoying himself.</p>\n\n<p>For the first time in months I don\u2019t see the robot, I see my husband.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: Hey everyone, I want to thank you all for the support. I read all of your comments, and I appreciate all of you. </p>\n\n<p>I didn\u2019t expect this to get so much traction, so I want to clarify some things. </p>\n\n<p>First things first, my husband says hi. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I wanted to clarify about the chores people are taking about. I want to say that I know as a SAHM the bulk of chores goes to me. I cook and clean and do laundry because I know it\u2019s my responsibility. My husband\u2019s only chores are doing dishes, vacuuming every three days, and a few other \u201chouse maintenance\u201d stuff. </p></li>\n<li><p>I did in fact call in sick for my husband, but I made sure that I said he had a migraine. I saw on google that it wasn\u2019t a symptom of COVID if it was an isolated symptom. His boss was okay with it and said he can come back whenever he feels better. </p></li>\n<li><p>The pregnancy wasn\u2019t an accident. We both did want to have 3 kids because we were both raised in 3 kid families. We actively tried for the first 2, but for baby number 3 it was kind of a \u201cif it happens it happens\u201d kind of thing. We\u2019re both happy with the amount of kids we have/ will have and are hopefully done. We are not considering abortion nor adoption. </p></li>\n<li><p>We realize that a one week vacation isn\u2019t enough to get rid of his stress and are both trying to come up with a solution that alleviates his stress in a more sustainable way. Right now we\u2019re thinking about setting up an hour or 2 a day that\u2019s, \u201cdaddy\u2019s time.\u201d No kids, no me, no work. Just for him to relax. </p></li>\n<li><p>To those of you who think this fake; there isn\u2019t any way I can change your minds about this situation so I\u2019m not really too bothered.

Oh my god, where to begin! My last post got WAY more attention than I could have ever imagined. Suffice to say, it was a tad bit overwhelming. Seriously, the amount of people begging for an update was a bit dehumanizing in a way. Like I wasn't a person going through something, but more so a \"story\". But I understand, haha.\n\nI just want to say thank you so so so much for all of the support and wonderful comments. I got a lot of great advice that helped me tackle the issue head on. I also got a lot of really really kind comments and messages. It was awesome.\n\nI also got a lot of comments that made me realize how toxic this sub can be. There were MANY comments that just said things like \"she's cheating, it's over\" and \"don't even confront her, just leave\". It's advice like that that can ruin relationships that just need a little work. \n\nAnd thank you to the people that told me to hit my girlfriend, told me I was an embarrassment to my gender, and best of all, told me I should encourage an affair because it would lead to great experiences for me later in life. You gave me a good chuckle.\n\n**ON TO THE UPDATE.**\n\nI decided to confront my girlfriend. I thought about using some of the lies people suggested, but they just wouldn't make sense. To say I ran into Justine somewhere: well, I told my girl I had to stay home and do stuff around the house, and that's why I couldn't go with her to see my SIL. To say Justine was helping me pick out jewelry: it doesn't make sense for her to come all the way to our house to help me pick out a piece of jewelry unless it was a serious piece of jewelry (like an engagement ring). If I just wanted to get her a piece of jewelry as a gift, I'd ask her friends for suggestions or ask them to send me pictures of jewelry she might like. It all happens over text. None of the excuses made sense. So, I decided to be honest. \n\nI basically just said that I knew we'd been thinking about marriage and she probably knew a proposal was coming soon so I invited Justine over to help me find her the perfect ring, and that so happened to be the day that she said she was going to see her, so... what's the deal?\n\nShe immediately started grinning like an idiot and prodding me about proposing and the ring, but then we got back onto the topic of where she was and she confessed what she was really doing. No, she wasn't cheating, and no, she wasn't picking out a ring for me (the amount of times that was commented was crazy). \n\nSo, some people are dog people and some people are cat people. Well, me, I'm a snake person. I grew up with snakes my whole life. But I never felt I was able to get one because my girlfriend has always been uneasy about living with a snake which I completely respected. Also, the process of buying and raising a snake is very different than that of buying and raising a dog or cat. It's quite complicated. So you could imagine my surprise when my girlfriend showed me a picture of her holding the cutest Kenyan sand boa I have EVER SEEN! \n\nNeedless to say, my girlfriend was going to surprise me with a snake! We're picking her up next week (let me know if you want a pet tax, she's so cute). I definitely did not expect this and I feel bad for ruining the surprise, but oh well. Life is good! Sorry if this isn't the ending you guys wanted or expected, just a snake haha. Thanks for reading!! \n\nTLDR: snake\n\nEdit #2: did you guys really award me 130 snek awards... I love reddit",

My son was busy with some assignments both for his freelancing job and his uni work most of the day and I didn't want to disturb him so I waited until after dinner to chat. \"Friend\" went to have a bath while my son and I watched telly. I tod him face to face \"Son, I love you very much. You don't have to tell me anything you don't want to, but I want you and [friend] to feel comfortable being yourselves in my house and you don't ever need to hide anything from me, alright?\" \n\nWell, it turns out a hell of a lot of you were right. Son burst out laughing and said \"oh thank *God*, I reckoned you'd clicked on but didn't say anything because *I* didn't want to make *you* feel weird\". Basically we've each been pussyfooting around the topic because neither one of us wanted to make the other uncomfortable talking about it. We had a bit of a chat and he confirmed that I'm right in thinking they've been together since their first year of uni and that's why they moved in together in second year. However, apparently I'm not as brilliant and intuitive as I thought because apparently one of his friends in secondary school was his boyfriend for a year and I had absolutely no idea haha. He went and talked to the boyfriend after his bath, and then we all had a bit of a further chat. Sadly a lot of you were right that the reason boyfriend doesn't have a good relationship with his parents is because he came out to them a few years ago and they effectively disowned him, so I made sure he knows that he's a part of our family now. \n\nSorry if that isn't all as exciting and groundbreaking as some of you had hoped haha! I'm glad this is something my boy no longer feels he has to keep from me and I'm very glad he's happy with his partner. Thank you all again for the help!",

I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.\n\nSo, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.\n\nI called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we'd had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected. \n\nSo, yeah. That's really it.\n\nOh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens.

I do think that, sometimes, new vegans can be a little overzealous. In reality, most of us are just doing the best that we can to not hurt animals! I did not expect to generate a big debate in the comments.</p>\n\n<p>So, we broke up, obviously. I would never, ever give up my cat Mittens. Many users said that this situation was about control, not veganism, and looking back, I do see a pattern of control on my GFs part. I was blind to it I guess.</p>\n\n<p>I called my GF and said I was not willing to give up Mittens under any circumstances, and given the recent issues we&#39;d had, and our incompatible views, I thought it was best that we parted ways. I said she deserved a partner that shared her values. She then asked if we were breaking up, I said yes. There was some anger on her end but otherwise the situation actually went better than I expected. </p>\n\n<p>So, yeah. That&#39;s really it.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and several users did ask to see a picture of Mittens. I have uploaded one to imgur:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/WxOk6qG\">https://imgur.com/a/WxOk6qG</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks again to everyone who offered advice. It really helped.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

I've been sexually assaulted too and this has affected me and subsequent relationships a lot. 2 days ago my girlfriend (23) was in my lap and we were making out and suddenly the images of rape came into my mind and I froze. She obviously sensed it and asked if everything was okay but I couldn't answer and I'd begun to sweat. She got of my lap and asked if I wanted to talk but i still couldn't say anything. Then she asked if she should leave the room and I gave a small nod. She just grabbed her phone from the table and left. This has never happened with me. Nobody has listened to my no before. It feels weird, different ? I don't know. \n\nNext morning when I woke up she had made breakfast and left me a note saying if I wanted to talk I could call her anytime. She came over after work and I thanked her for listening to me, I was almost in tears. She welled up too and said no obviously means no, but hesitation means no too. And that she would never knowingly hurt me. I've never been treated like this before. My parents were shit, and almost every relationship I've had (3) were also similarly shit. \n\nBut she's different, she's been my rock when I've fallen low, she cooks for me because she wants me to be healthy, she leaves notes of affirmation all over the house for me to find and is generally the most genuine amazing person I've ever met. I want to show my gratitude to her and want to tell her how much she means to me but I don't know how ? Also it's still weighing on me how my say matters to her. Never in my life have I ever been treated this way. \n\nSo how do I tell how much she means to me ? And will I stop feeling this way ?\n\n\nEDIT:- oh my god, y'all. I never expected this kind of response! I'm trying to read through them all but thank you so much! \n\nTo clarify a few things, almost everyone who commented suggested therapy. Therapy is super expensive and I'm already working to pay for school but yes I've started therapy, it's been about 5 months now. Just taking baby steps here. \n\nSecondly y'all gave a ton of good ideas but I think I'm gonna write her a letter and maybe arrange for a small picnic for the two of us. I know she'll love it. \n\nFor those saying I should propose, that's definitely the plan, just not now. \n\nAnd to those who shared their (similar) Experiences, thank you. It gave me an insight and I hope things look up for you. \n\nAnd for all those who said I'm a 'pussy' for getting raped or I'm lying, I'm sorry but I can't make y'all believe me. I hope y'all feel better after this.b\n\n\nAgain, thank you so much for your kind comments. Y'all are amazeballs.",

A lot has happened in the past two weeks so I'm going to try to go over it as best I can.\n\nMy wife and I started talking again. We had a very serious conversation and I did apologize for what I did to her running shoes, and then I told her I had to speak some truth and I wanted her to promise me that she wasn't going to roll her eyes, interrupt me, scoff, or get sarcastic with me, which she did. I told her that I was not kidding about my boots, that while most of the time I caught geriatric transports, falls, and nausea, there were instances where response time was of the essence and I didn't have time to play around with my boots in the middle of the night. I told her that there have been times when my intervention has been critical in saving a life, when my training has helped me recognize an underlying emergency, or when a call I made ensured that a patient was prioritized upon arrival at the hospital. I explained that a lot of the shit I see, I don't tell her about because I don't want to give her nightmares or make her worry about me. She actually listened and didn't dismiss what I had to say. She responded that she was trying to help by keeping things neat.\n\nI responded, \"But you're not. Sweetie, I'm not trying to be mean, but you're not helping. You're hindering me. One day it may be the difference between life and death. I need you to not touch my gear. It's where I know where it is, it's where I can easily find it in a short amount of time, and if you move it, you are impeding an emergency response. I don't care if it looks neat. It serves a function, it doesn't look pretty. If you want to help me, please leave my gear where I put it.\"\n\nA few nights later I had my friend Officer Rich come over. Officer Rich was one of the two cops that did CPR on the victim that night. The three of us sat on our deck and had a few social distancing beers. He talked about getting there, doing CPR, giving Narcan, waiting for the ambulance and getting her back shortly before we got there.\n\nHe then pulled out a few photos of car accidents that I had worked. He showed them to my wife and pointed out, \"This car went into a tree. Your husband crawled into the wreck, put a collar on the driver, and stayed in there giving him oxygen until we could get him out.\" \"Your husband pulled a three year old out of this wreck.\" \"Your husband recognized that the driver had a stroke and took her to a stroke center, which likely saved her life.\"\n\nAfter that, I told her I had something I wanted to show her and I asked her for the same promise I'd asked earlier. When she agreed, I showed her a video on YouTube of a police bodycam from an overdose. This video showed how critical time is in getting someone back, and the training someone goes through in order to give the drug, do CPR, and utilize an AED.\n\nI told her, \"I'm not trying to attack you, I don't want to have a fight, but I want you to understand what I go through. That I hope every call I go on is transporting a boo boo, because otherwise it means that if I don't do everything right someone could die. If I don't get out that door as quickly as possible, someone could suffer brain damage while they're waiting for me to give them oxygen. If I'm upset and shaking because I had to waste time opening my boots, I might miss something critical and someone might not make it.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that she understood and told me she hadn't really thought about the danger of what I do until the other night when she saw the photos of the wrecks. I told her that I think she has OCD and needs to see a therapist because it's hurting our marriage. I listed examples of her throwing important things out, moving things without permission, and messing with my gear. I offered to go together and said I'd be willing to work on things together.\n\nAfter I pointed out the pattern, she agreed that it was time to speak to someone. She wants to think about whether she wants to go together or go by herself, but she has promised me that she's going to try to change her patterns. I brought up her saying she thought I was going to hit her, and she acknowledged she'd been with guys who flew off the handle with little provocation and scared her. That she'd never seen me get that angry and it triggered her because she didn't think I was capable of blowing up like that.\n\nShe's been very emotional lately and has been going through mood swings. She's been worried about me going out on calls. The other day she started crying and said, \"I hope you know how much I appreciate what you do.\" Knock on wood, since we had the big talk, she hasn't touched my boots.\n\nIs everything resolved? Not by a longshot. But she seems to have a new appreciation for what I do. Thank you for all of your responses. I wound up not showing her the thread, because a lot of it was pretty harsh towards her. I recognize I cherry picked incidents that didn't put her in the best light, and there's a lot more to her and our marriage than that. She is the person I chose for the rest of my life, and I want us to work.\n\ntl;dr Let my wife into my world a little more, she let me into hers, and she hasn't touched my boots since.",

        "selftext": "Hey guys,\n\nI need some serious advice as i'm pretty much being cornered by basically everyone and i really don't know what else to do as my mental state is declining and i'm left wondering if it's really all my fault?\n\nA little background: \n\nMe and my ex-fianc\u00e9e had been together for almost 6 years and engaged for 4 out of those 6 years. I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.\n\nBack in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it's her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it's only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.\n\nIt all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving.

I fucking blew up, i wanted nothing to do with her and was going to break up with her until she got on her knees and begged me to give her a second chance which my dumbass self did but only after she revealed everything to me and she did. It made me fucking sick to my stomach but in the end i forgave her and told her to delete all contact with the other guy and that i expect her to have no contact with him going forward which she promised and things kinda went back to before.\n\nHeck, we were even spending more time together but that feeling, that trust wasn't there anymore.\n\nEverything was kinda OK until 2 weeks ago a friend of mine who was visiting another city which was 3 hours from where i lived sent me a picture with the message \"Sorry bro\" that broke my already broken heart into a billion of little pieces. The picture was of my ex-fianc\u00e9e at a mall 3 hours away from where we lived holding hands with some stranger who i didn't know. I fucking broke down, i was heartbroken. She was a bitch, a piece of shit especially since i thought she was at work while in reality she was 3 hours away holding hands with her lover.\n\nWhen i got home from work i waited for her and right away confronted her which she denied and called me a psycho for not believing her and that i was a piece of shit for not trusting her until i showed her the picture that my friend sent me. Her face told me everything and when the waterworks started i knew that i had made a huge mistake in taking her back so i ended it.\n\nShe cried and fucking begged me to think it over and not to throw away everythink that we have together which made me fucking angry and i'm not going to lie but i fucking slapped her. I was not proud, i'm still not but she saying shit like not to throw away everthing when it was her who threwaway everything pissed me off.\n\nI told her to pack her shit and leave, called her parents and mine and told them everything, her parents came to help her and i told them to basically fuck off after they told me to think it over and to make the right decision before actually ending it. She begged me not to end things but i did, had to for my own piece of mind.\n\nI did not hear from her or her parents until 3 days ago when my parents called me to let know that ex-fianc\u00e9e had comitted suicide. Her parents found her hanging and she had left a letter apologising to everyone including my parents and me and how she is sorry from the bottom of her heart for what she did to me and that how she can't live without me and because of that she ended it.\n\nI am at a fucking lose, ex-fianc\u00e9e friends and family are blaming me and my own mother told me that it was my fault, she told me that i should have forgiven her since i'm clearly worth comitting suicide over. \n\nI am fucking disgusted, i have currently taken some time off from work and have not a single clue what to do.",

I was introduced to her by a close friend at a party and we just clicked. She was attractive, had a great personality and had similar hobbies as me which made it perfect.</p>\n\n<p>Back in April of this year i started noticing little changes in her, she started wearing more revealing clothes to work, started putting more make-up and etc. Tbh i had no problem with any of that stuff as it&#39;s her body, she can wear whatever and put how ever much make-up she wanted to but what made things worse for me was when she started coming home late from work or how instead of spending the weekend off with me (we both had weekends off from work) she instead was always going out. I once had asked her why she never invited me to come out with her to which she replied that it&#39;s only girls night out and that her other friends would not be happy if i tagged along as they were not bringing their own bf with them.</p>\n\n<p>It all came crashing down when me and her had a huge fight in June because she decided that instead of going out on a date with me she told me how she already had made plans with her friends and that it was rude of her to cancel. That was it for me, i fucking blew up at her and we had huge fight which resulted in her packing her bags and leaving.

The PC gaming market grew to $36 billion in 2016, with F2P games like League of Legends, World of Tanks, and DOTA 2 [leading the charge](http://www.pcgamer.com/pc-gaming-market-worth-36-billion-in-2016/). \n\nThe New York Attorney General is suing Time Warner Cable right now for [interfering with both Netflix *and* League of Legends players](http://www.polygon.com/2017/2/9/14548880/time-warner-lawsuit-new-york-league-of-legends-netflix).

        "selftext": "  \n\nThings are clear now, while playing PUBG, Apex or CSGO, if there is only one hacker in the battle, the whole experience will be horrible. And without exception, the majority of hackers are from China.\n\nFor the first time I know hacks, I was twelve years old, which is ten years ago. But things are way better than today. I witness the vicious spread of this grey industry chain, and today I want to explain why this happened.\n\nFirst thing I want to talk about is the choice between vanity and honor. There is a slang in China, \u201ca child from another family\u201d, which represent an ideal kid who is better than you in every way. You will hear the \u201clegend\u201d stories of this kid from your parents, teachers, and relatives. After telling you the story, they always tell you that you should get good grades like him, be talented like him, get as many prizes as he gets. They give you peer pressure by creating a fake kid, but they don\u2019t teach you HOW to be this kid. So, all we know is competing with others, while they don\u2019t care how we win a competition. So if you tell me that I can win a game without effort just by using hacks, yes of course I will use it, the majority of our generation don\u2019t care about the honor of efforts or the way we win, we just care about that we can win.\n\nThe second thing is piracy. In China, steam was not widely known until 2015, pirate was our only option if we want to play PC games. Alone with those pirate games, we would also download what we called \u201cmodifier(I\u2019m not sure if you guys call it this way)\u201d. Almost all players from our generation experienced PlantsvsZombies with infinite sunlight, call of duty with infinity HP and ammo (Makarov can\u2019t even kill you in \u201cno Russian\u201d). It is fun when we play the single player mod with modifiers, but it is also at this moment, some of us become dependent on software that can \u201cboost\u201d our performance. You might ask that piracy is also an issue in Russia, but why Chinese hackers are much more, this question leads to the third.\n\nI shall call the third reason \u201cexcess production capacity\u201d. In the last decade, China experienced the explosive development of the Internet, major in Computer science was such a popular option in university. However, as the bubble burst, many programmers were not hired by mainstream companies. And a huge amount of them was worked for anti-virus software companies and now they are unemployed. You can imagine how easy it could be for them to create a hack by their knowledge. They need to survive, so they choose to degenerate. There are even competitions among those hack studios, I won\u2019t tell you how, but I can assure you that you can purchase a hack of CSGO for a week for only 6 dollars. It is so easy to get and so cheap.\n\nAs we can see here, with the abnormal social education, dependence on \u201cboosters\u201d and cheap purchase channels, we are what we are now, the majority of game hackers. Those hackers don\u2019t even know they are ruining the environment, they just want to pursue the pleasure over and over again, kind like drugs, right? Actually sometimes I feel pity for them, some of them even think that steam is the starter of PUBG and origin is the starter of Apex.\n\nPlease trust me, every time I see the news that Chinese players are ruining another game, I feel so powerless. I can\u2019t explain to all hackers that how proud you would be if you win a game by your own effort, I can\u2019t explain to you guys what are the reasons that caused this situation. Making hacks is illegal in China now, but we still can\u2019t handle games like Apex which share global servers (because of the vague expressions in law).\n\nAnd also trust me that many players in China agree with my opinion, we feel shame about using hacks, but we are still minority. All we can do is advocating people around us not to use it. We are changing this situation, but it may cost years to change it for real.\n\nIf you have read this far, thanks for putting up with my poor English, it is midnight here, I still have classes tmr morning. If you have any questions, I will answer them at my best when I am available.",

        "selftext": "Greetings r/pcgaming,\n\nRecently, Reddit has announced some [changes to their API](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/13wshdp/api_update_continued_access_to_our_api_for/) that may have pretty serious impact on many of it's users.\n\n[You may have already seen quite a few posts like these](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/1401qw5/incomplete_and_growing_list_of_participating/) across some of the other subreddits that you browse, so we're just going to cut to the chase.\n\n# What's Happening\n\n* Third Party Reddit apps (such as Apollo, Reddit is Fun and others) are going to become ludicrously more expensive for it's developers to run, which will in turn either kill the apps, or result in a monthly fee to the users if they choose to use one of those apps to browse. Put simply, each request to Reddit within these mobile apps will cost the developer money. The developers of Apollo [were quoted around $2 million per month](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/13ws4w3/had_a_call_with_reddit_to_discuss_pricing_bad/) for the current rate of usage. The only way for these apps to continue to be viable for the developer is if you (the user) pay a monthly fee, and realistically, this is most likely going to just outright kill them. **Put simply: If you use a third party app to browse Reddit, you will most likely no longer be able to do so, or be charged a monthly fee to keep it viable.**\n\n  * A big reason this matters to r/pcgaming, and why we believe it matters to you, is that during our last user demographics survey, [of 2,500 responses, 22.4% of users say they primarily use a third party app to browse the subreddit](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/482367144101806090/1114653103925514410/image.png). Using this as sort of a sample size, even significantly reduced, is a non-negligible portion of our user base being forced to change the way they browse Reddit.\n\n  * Some people with visual impairments have problems using the official mobile app, and the removal of third-party apps may significantly hinder their ability to browse Reddit in general. [More info](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/)\n\n  * Many moderators are going to be significantly hindered from moderating their communities because 3rd party mobile apps provide mod tools that the official app doesn't support. This means longer wait times on post approvals, reports, modmails etc.\n\n* NSFW Content is no longer going to be available in the API. This means that, even if 3rd party apps continue to survive, or even if you pay a fee to use a 3rd party app, you will not be able to access NSFW content on it. You will only be able to access it on the official Reddit app. Additionally, some service bots (such as video downloaders or maybe remindme bots) will not be able to access anything NSFW. In more major cases, it may become harder for moderators of NSFW subreddits to combat serious violations such as CSAM due to certain mod tools being restricted from accessing NSFW content.\n\nNote: A lot of this has been sourced and inspired from a fantastic mod-post on r/wow, they do a great job going in-depth on the entire situation. Major props to the team over there! [You can read their post here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/13ymdue/reddit_api_changes_subreddit_blackouts_and_you/)\n\n# Open Letter to Reddit & Blackout\n\nIn lieu of what's happening above, [an open letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/) has been released by the broader moderation community, and r/pcgaming will be supporting it.\n\nPart of this initiative includes a potential subreddit blackout (meaning, the subreddit will be privatized) on June 12th, lasting 24-48 hours or longer. On one hand, this is great to hopefully make enough of an impact to influence Reddit to change their minds on this. On the other hand, we usually stay out of these blackouts, and we would rather not negatively impact usage of the subreddit, especially during the summer events cycle. If we chose to black out for 24 hours, on June 12th, that is the date of the Ubisoft Forward showcase event. If we chose to blackout for 48 hours, the subreddit would also be private during the Xbox Extended Showcase. \n\nWe would like to give the community a voice in this. Is this an important enough matter that r/pcgaming should fully support the protest and blackout the subreddit for at least 24 hours on June 12th? How long if we do? Feel free to leave your thoughts and opinions below. \n\nCheers,\n\nr/pcgaming Mod Team\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE 6/9 8am: As of right now, due to overwhelming community support, we are planning on continuing with the blackout on June 12th. Today there will be an AMA with /u/spez and that will determine our course. We'll keep you all updated as get more info. You can also follow along at /r/ModCoord and /r/Save3rdPartyApps.",

Just in case it was not completely clear before, [u/DapperPenguinStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperPenguinStudios) **was not contacted by Epic Games for an exclusivity deal.** It was all a misunderstanding, and you can see how the confusion arose by reading the rest of this post and the comments.

[u/DapperPenguinStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperPenguinStudios) made a statement [here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/671440/discussions/0/1651043320657573992/?ctp=2) with regards to the whole situation. Instead of paraphrasing his own words, I believe that you should read everything he is saying for yourself. For now I will keep the bulk of the original post unedited so that readers have some context as to the whole confusion, but might change it later on.\n\n**Second Edit:** The makers of Rise of Industry commented here! Make sure to thank  [u/DapperPenguinStudios](https://www.reddit.com/user/DapperPenguinStudios) for supporting consumer-friendly practices and to read some of the comments as they shed more light on the Epic exclusives.\n\n**Edit:** We've actually managed to make this one of the top r/all posts! Keep up the good work and r/fuckepic!\n\nDevelopers are starting to openly express that they have declined or would not accept exclusivity deals for their game.\n\nApparently Epic tried to snatch Rise of Industry, which is currently on Steam, but the company [declined](https://imgur.com/a/CJO1UsR) the deal because they do not believe in restricting player choice. [This link](https://imgur.com/a/wfyWCR0) provides more context with regards to the exclusivity decision. Keep in mind that this game has been in early access on Steam for a very long time, and for Epic to try to snatch the game under such circumstances is extremely scummy.\n\nFactorio is another game that Epic is very likely to have tried to grab as an exclusive. In their latest [developer blog](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-293), Factorio devs stated that there will be  ''no selling-out to big companies that would use the game as cash grab  while destroying the brand (we actually declined to negotiate  \"investment opportunities\" like this several times already, no matter  what the price would be), the same would be when it would potentially come to any exclusivity deals, which is its own subject... ''\n\nMonths ago, CD Projekt Red [publicly stated](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-an-epic-store-exclusive-cd-projekt-red-confirms/) that they are giving any possibility of exclusivity or co-exclusivity for Cyberpunk 2077 a pass on Twitter when asked about their stance.\n\nChris Avellone who used to work at Obsidian, called the Outer World exclusivity deal a [cash grab](https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-outer-worlds/chris-avellone-epic-games-store). He is currently a writer for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and stated on twitter that while the game will also launch on EGS, it will not be exclusive because of the importance of player choice.\n\nThe point of all of this is that the consumer backlash is finally starting to take effect, otherwise developers would not use them declining an exclusivity deal as a source of positive PR that they can share with the public.\n\nThanks to r/fuckepic for digging out this information.\n\nIf any of you happen to know of any other game companies that have declined epic exclusivity deals, message me and I will include them in this post.",

I found out on the 17th that there was unauthorized purchases on my account. I was able to perform a password reset (hacker did not reset my account security information other then password), logged into my account after a password change and removed my CC from my profile. On the 17th I also sent an email via their support system to EpicGames stating my account was hacked. I explained to them that the purchases were not legit and asked for a refund. (mind you this is the only form of contact EpicGames has) days later, no responses, sent follow up email, again on the 21st stating, almost 3 days later, still no response from EpicGames.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI advised them in my 2nd email that if I did not receive a response with 3 business days. I was going to dispute the charges with my bank as the window for disputing was closing and I still did not receive any responses... On the 23rd I disputed the charges with my bank and immediately after received an email from EpicGames stating my account was **permanently** suspended and could not be reactivated.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo now my account is locked and I am unable to play Fortnite (the paid save the world edition, not battle royal). Below are the emails and transactions from my account as proof. You can even go to EpicGames website and attempt to search for contact info. You will find email is the only contact method.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI strongly advise anyone using EpicGame services to be cautious about continuing to use their services. Their user support is basically non existent. If your account gets hack and you lose money, they will do nothing to assist to resolve the problems. In good conscience, I can not let this go by on the way side without making it known to the public. This is pure criminal actions of a company that deals with currency transactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[https://i.redd.it/0hn0mvdwfmz01.png](https://i.redd.it/0hn0mvdwfmz01.png)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/gandbcvpfmz01.png](https://i.redd.it/gandbcvpfmz01.png)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/6hwk6mrvfmz01.png](https://i.redd.it/6hwk6mrvfmz01.png)\n\n[https://i.redd.it/sgs9wtyygmz01.png](https://i.redd.it/sgs9wtyygmz01.png)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*EDIT\\*\n\nQuick edit to clear up a few things that I see people continually commenting on so lets clear this up so I don't have to repeat myself.:\n\nFirstly, my Epic account was created before 2FA and failed login attempt lock outs were even a thing. I used this to purchase \"Save the world\" edition. This was before Battle Royal was out, and before better security was put into place. Without the above security things like BRUTE FORCE ATTACKS are very common (however it could have also been a leak on Epics end, while there are threads on this subject. I've yet to been able to verify any such leaks). Secondly. I stated \"transferred coins\" out from my account. This was an assumption, and I may have been wrong about what exactly they used the vbucks on. It may have been used to purchase skins and other items to gift them, or vbucks may have been purchased to pad my account before selling it. In either case. The facts are as presented of the issue at hand. Account was hacked and emails shown are via Epic games ticket submission system. There is also an Epic games ticket number as shown in the 2nd email image above.\n\n\\*Additional Edits\\*\n\nFor those asking for receipts of the hackers purchases. See below pictures. (also note the descriptions in another language...)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/S7jmF0f](https://imgur.com/a/S7jmF0f)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/EM3Ildh](https://imgur.com/a/EM3Ildh)\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/v8zC7pp](https://imgur.com/a/v8zC7pp)\n\nI would also like to add. Since writing of this post, I have been contacted by two employees at Epic Games (see below), and they have since restored my account, as well as provided me with 5k v-bucks. While I am happy the company is putting effort into fixing this. (it is appreciated). This whole issue could have been completely avoided from the get go, and because so I will not be returning to the platform. The issue here was lack of response from the company through **THEIR OWN** official channels that had to be bypassed and escalated to a public forum for anything to have been done about it. (no ill will towards Epic Games. I just don't see how the root cause of this issue could possible be resolved). However, I do commend them on reaching out, and attempting to make the issue right. They should received some credit for doing so instead of simply ignoring this thread altogether.\n\n[https://imgur.com/a/RsnfZ3y](https://imgur.com/a/RsnfZ3y)\n\nThank you for those that believed my case and understanding my aspect on the situation.\n\n&#x200B;",

        "selftext": "#Not April Fool\u2019s. \n\nThis April Fool\u2019s, we decided to take things a little more seriously and shed some light on a growing, pervasive issue that has affected the community of r/Games and gaming communities as a whole. In recent times, it\u2019s come to our attention that what has been intended to be a forum for the potential spread of knowledge and involvement in video games has instead become a battleground of conflicting ideas. Ordinarily, this isn\u2019t an issue; discussion by its very nature is certain to bring argument, but when that argument descends into vitriolic attacks between individuals on a regular basis with no chance at deescalation, that\u2019s when, put simply, something\u2019s got to give.\n\nThough certain memes (such as \u201cgamers rise up\u201d) surrounding gaming are largely viewed as a humorous interpretation of a mindset, at the core of the humor is a set of very serious issues that affect all gaming enthusiasts. By showing disdain or outright rejecting minority and marginalized communities, we become more insular. In this, we lose out on the chance to not only show compassion to these people, but also the chance to grow our own community and diversify the demographics of those involved in it. Whether it\u2019s misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, racism or a host of other discriminatory practices, now is the time to stymie the flow of regressive ideas and prevent them from ever becoming the norm.\n\nAt r/Games, our community is becoming increasingly responsible for perpetuating a significant amount of these combative and derogatory schools of thought. We remove those comments, we ban the perpetrators, but the issue still persists at a fundamental level: the notion that it\u2019s okay or acceptable to ridicule and demonize traditionally disenfranchised and marginalized members in the gaming community. This is not just an issue in r/Games or on Reddit alone; this is an issue deeply embedded in the ranging depths of the internet, frequently in communities that center around the discussion of games.\n\n##What We See\n\nUnfortunately, this inflammatory content is not an infrequent occurrence. The condescending, dismissive, vindictive and pessimistic attitudes we see in our day to day activity is troubling, especially when those interactions involve harassing or outright targeting regularly discriminated communities. It\u2019s not uncommon for us to see the real issues surrounding these communities be trivialized, derided out of ignorance, or worse, for the sake of entertainment.\n\nTo that end, we want to show you, the community, what we mean by \u201cwhat we see\u201d. These are some of the more awful comments we see regarding [transphobia](https://i.imgur.com/HPS9DKW.png), [homophobia](https://i.imgur.com/S1FGkbd.jpg), [islamophobia](https://i.imgur.com/YNxb69G.jpg), [racism](https://i.imgur.com/MdIZgNn.jpg), [misogyny](https://i.imgur.com/TVd4DKx.jpg), [pro-pedophilia/pro-rape](https://i.imgur.com/2l4Rdxk.jpg), and [vitriolic personal attacks against other users](https://i.imgur.com/Q0qrIVJ.jpg). These kinds of comments occur on a daily basis. [We\u2019ve compiled an entire album of examples](https://imgur.com/a/umrdBYF) of the horrible things people say on this subreddit. From bigotry to vitriol, this album merely scratches the surface of the magnitude of the problem.\n\nIn the interest of providing examples, we elected to remove the usernames from these comments; instead, our intent is to show the stark reality that we face on a daily basis in the overall effort to provide a welcoming and responsive community. Preventing the cultivation of bigotry means giving it no ground to go to, and as a whole leave only space for those who would respectfully participate. We must closely examine our own communities, in an effort to encourage acceptance and inclusion, to foster a healthy community in which we value empathy and respect. \n\n\n\n\n##Do Better; Be Better\n\nDespite the strife that\u2019s both within and caused by our community, there are a multitude of opportunities to prove that we can come together and be a more wholesome, accepting community that exists on a single core idea: enjoying and discussing video games together. Though the industry as a whole has suffered a great deal of trials and tribulations, we also are fortunate enough to be at a point in time in which there seem to be a glut of fantastic games, from major AAA titles down to near-anonymous indie projects that come out of nowhere. \n\nSo let\u2019s revel in what\u2019s available to us, and also appreciate the myriad of backgrounds that we as gamers come from. Our differences in experiences comprise the diversity in the content that we consume, and by allowing ourselves to appreciate those differences, we change our perspectives and interpretations; this applies not only in games, but life as a whole.\n\nLet\u2019s not let the good eggs go unnoticed, though: There are plenty of you who, as members of the community, want to take care of one another. Sometimes this means identifying when conversation becomes confrontation, when discussion gets out of hand and turns to name-calling, slurs or other degrading language. To you, we say thank you. You\u2019re what keep us going, you\u2019re who we want to see more of, and you\u2019re everything that is the potential for a strong, open community for those who love and enjoy video games the way we do.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to recognize the opportunities not afforded to everyone, as well as the resources available to give them a helping hand. So this April Fool\u2019s, we\u2019re also asking you to take into consideration the idea of helping these organizations out. These folks have made it their mission to represent and benefit those who still face their own challenges, obstacles and prejudices, and any assistance they can get is another step forward for their cause.\n\n##LGBT+ Charities:\n\n[The Trevor Project](https://www.thetrevorproject.org)\n\n[Resource Center](https://myresourcecenter.org/)\n\n[Point Foundation](http://www.pointfoundation.org/)\n\n[GLAAD](http://www.glad.org/)\n\n[Ali Forney Center](https://www.aliforneycenter.org/)\n\n[New Alternatives](https://www.newalternativesnyc.org/)\n\n[International Lesbian and Gay Association Europe](http://www.ilga-europe.org/)\n\n[Global Rights](http://www.globalrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=wwd_LGBTI)\n\n##POC-focused Charities:\n\n[National Civil Rights Museum](http://www.civilrightsmuseum.org/)\n\n[Center for Constitutional Rights](http://www.ccrjustice.org/)\n\n[Sponsors for Educational Opportunity](http://www.seo-usa.org/)\n\n[Race Forward](https://www.raceforward.org/)\n\n##Women\u2019s health charities:\n\n[Planned Parenthood](https://www.weareplannedparenthood.org/onlineactions/2U7UN1iNhESWUfDs4gDPNg2?sourceid=1000063)\n\n[Reproductive Health Access Project](https://www.reproductiveaccess.org/)\n\n[Centre for Reproductive Rights](https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=3454#)\n\n[Support Line](https://www.supportline.org.uk/problems/rape-and-sexual-assault/)\n\n[Rainn](https://www.rainn.org/)\n\n##Additional Causes:\n\n[Able Gamers](https://ablegamers.org/)\n\n[Paws with a Cause](https://www.pawswithacause.org/)\n\n[Child's Play](https://childsplaycharity.org/)\n\n[Out of the Closet Thrift Store](https://outofthecloset.org/)\n\n[Life After Hate](https://www.lifeafterhate.org/)\n\n___\n\n*Remember the human*\n\n\\- r/Games mod team",

These folks have made it their mission to represent and benefit those who still face their own challenges, obstacles and prejudices, and any assistance they can get is another step forward for their cause.</p>\n\n<h2>LGBT+ Charities:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thetrevorproject.org\">The Trevor Project</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://myresourcecenter.org/\">Resource Center</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.pointfoundation.org/\">Point Foundation</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.glad.org/\">GLAAD</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.aliforneycenter.org/\">Ali Forney Center</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newalternativesnyc.org/\">New Alternatives</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ilga-europe.org/\">International Lesbian and Gay Association Europe</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.globalrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=wwd_LGBTI\">Global Rights</a></p>\n\n<h2>POC-focused Charities:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.civilrightsmuseum.org/\">National Civil Rights Museum</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ccrjustice.org/\">Center for Constitutional Rights</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.seo-usa.org/\">Sponsors for Educational Opportunity</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.raceforward.org/\">Race Forward</a></p>\n\n<h2>Women\u2019s health charities:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.weareplannedparenthood.org/onlineactions/2U7UN1iNhESWUfDs4gDPNg2?sourceid=1000063\">Planned Parenthood</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reproductiveaccess.org/\">Reproductive Health Access Project</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=3454#\">Centre for Reproductive Rights</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.supportline.org.uk/problems/rape-and-sexual-assault/\">Support Line</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.rainn.org/\">Rainn</a></p>\n\n<h2>Additional Causes:</h2>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ablegamers.org/\">Able Gamers</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pawswithacause.org/\">Paws with a Cause</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://childsplaycharity.org/\">Child&#39;s Play</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://outofthecloset.org/\">Out of the Closet Thrift Store</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lifeafterhate.org/\">Life After Hate</a></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><em>Remember the human</em></p>\n\n<p>- <a href=\"/r/Games\">r/Games</a> mod team</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

        "selftext": "Let me take 5 minutes out of your day to fill you in on why I'm so fucking pissed.\n\nLike many of you, I started gaming as young as 6 years old. As far as I can recall, my first game ever was Petz Horsez for my bright pink Gameboy Advance SP. As a little girl who was completely new to gaming, this was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me. Complete with shitty chiptune music on an 8 second loop and comedically awful sound effects, this game blew my mind despite the fact that it was mind numbingly boring. The seed was planted, this was only the beginning.\n\nFast forward about 3 years. I've played nearly every horse game in the Petz franchise a hundred times over, primarily on the Wii, DS, and DSI. Of course the stories are pointless, the gameplay is repetitive and obnoxious, but I was still happy. It had horses in it. I branched out to some other titles, most of them liscensed by Nintendo, but nothing was exciting me like it had before. Every horse game was a copy of another horse game, which was a copy of another horse game. This happens to be the same year that I actually touched a real horse. I liked it so much, I decided I wanted to give riding lessons a try. My wonderful parents humored me, and I sat on a horse and walked around with her once a week. Consider me enamored at this point, I wanted to do this for the rest of my life! Unfortunately, that's not how budgets work. Back to the handheld ranch. \n\nAt 9 my expectations were still low, but the fog of childhood wonder was beginning to lift. My horse games were boring, unrealistic, sugarcoated, and obnoxiously catered towards little girls that didn't know a damn thing about the equestrian world! With the newfound glory of the internet at my side, I set out on a mission to find it. The ultimate horse game. Wiimote in hand, I scoured the internet. I read every top ten list, bought every 4 star 2 review horse game off of Amazon, braved my local gamestop for any sign of a halfway decent horse game. After years of trials, I only found one horse game that was tolerable as far as progression, realism, and gameplay are concerned... Gallop & Ride for the Wii.\n\nThis was an underwhelming result, but it was something. After playing the game to death, I could say with confidence it was the best game I'd ever played in the genre, but that wasn't a huge achievement. It did some things right. In the game you play as the heir and manager of a sort of dude ranch. Guests come to stay at your inn, ride your horses, and enjoy the scenery. The game introduced some impressive concepts, such as vaccination, strain on your working horses, and a fun points system besides the regular currency. The controls were obnoxious, as every wii horse game demands you hold the Wiimote and nunchuk as if they were reigns, but this beautiful game gave you the option to toggle your riding controls to a basic joystick and A button. Already 10x better. I have reason to believe other competitors in the horse genre thought little girls were too stupid to even navigate to the settings, since no other game had this possibility. Thank you, Gallop & Ride. You didn't suck so much.\n\nHere's why I'm pissed. While Gallop & Ride was one of the most mature equestrian games I've ever played, it's basically a unicorn. As a 19 year old woman who is still shamelessly infatuated with horse games, I cannot find a single game on any console, much less PC, that boasts the same performance. Star Stable? Are you kidding me? Howrse? It doesn't even have gameplay. You know your favorite genre is suffering when the only tolerable way to play it is IN OTHER GENRES. While Horsez did get me started, I thankfully moved on to greener pastures. I discovered Pok\u00e9mon, The Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, all the games I love as an adult. I can say with confidence, Breath of the Wild does horse physics and mannerisms better than any specialized horse game. If you google \"horse games\" some of your top results will consist of Red Dead Redemption, Shadow of the Colossus, and Breath of the Wild... My friends, these are obviously not horse games.\n\nI didn't enter the horse gaming world to make friends. I'm here to make champions, bank, and a helluva reputation. I want to see my horses die, I want to break out of this pocket dimension that every horse game seems to be stuck in and watch my estate age as it would in reality. A serious equestrian gamer doesn't have time for projectile hearts and 5 minute long nose rubs, we want gameplay. Where is the strategic breeding? The real world illnesses and dilemmas, the branching careers, the satisfaction of rising to the occasion and being the best goddamn manager and equestrian you can be? Where is the soul? I truly believe this is a game that hasn't been made yet. I can't say with certainty whether there is or isn't an equestrian game demand. Maybe I'm the only one who gives a shit, and I'm destined to be angry about this for the rest of my life. But, should anybody else share in this passion, there is a serious genre to be fulfilled here. I won't lose hope, and as someone interested in game design, I won't abandon my own ideas for what the ultimate horse game should look like, but for god's sake, give the weird horse girls and guys of the world something to look forward to.\n\nThank you.\n\nHere is a link to the presentation that inspired me to raise hell.

After playing the game to death, I could say with confidence it was the best game I&#39;d ever played in the genre, but that wasn&#39;t a huge achievement. It did some things right. In the game you play as the heir and manager of a sort of dude ranch. Guests come to stay at your inn, ride your horses, and enjoy the scenery. The game introduced some impressive concepts, such as vaccination, strain on your working horses, and a fun points system besides the regular currency. The controls were obnoxious, as every wii horse game demands you hold the Wiimote and nunchuk as if they were reigns, but this beautiful game gave you the option to toggle your riding controls to a basic joystick and A button. Already 10x better. I have reason to believe other competitors in the horse genre thought little girls were too stupid to even navigate to the settings, since no other game had this possibility. Thank you, Gallop &amp; Ride. You didn&#39;t suck so much.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s why I&#39;m pissed. While Gallop &amp; Ride was one of the most mature equestrian games I&#39;ve ever played, it&#39;s basically a unicorn. As a 19 year old woman who is still shamelessly infatuated with horse games, I cannot find a single game on any console, much less PC, that boasts the same performance. Star Stable? Are you kidding me? Howrse? It doesn&#39;t even have gameplay. You know your favorite genre is suffering when the only tolerable way to play it is IN OTHER GENRES. While Horsez did get me started, I thankfully moved on to greener pastures. I discovered Pok\u00e9mon, The Legend of Zelda, Dark Souls, all the games I love as an adult. I can say with confidence, Breath of the Wild does horse physics and mannerisms better than any specialized horse game. If you google &quot;horse games&quot; some of your top results will consist of Red Dead Redemption, Shadow of the Colossus, and Breath of the Wild... My friends, these are obviously not horse games.</p>\n\n<p>I didn&#39;t enter the horse gaming world to make friends. I&#39;m here to make champions, bank, and a helluva reputation. I want to see my horses die, I want to break out of this pocket dimension that every horse game seems to be stuck in and watch my estate age as it would in reality. A serious equestrian gamer doesn&#39;t have time for projectile hearts and 5 minute long nose rubs, we want gameplay. Where is the strategic breeding? The real world illnesses and dilemmas, the branching careers, the satisfaction of rising to the occasion and being the best goddamn manager and equestrian you can be? Where is the soul? I truly believe this is a game that hasn&#39;t been made yet. I can&#39;t say with certainty whether there is or isn&#39;t an equestrian game demand. Maybe I&#39;m the only one who gives a shit, and I&#39;m destined to be angry about this for the rest of my life. But, should anybody else share in this passion, there is a serious genre to be fulfilled here. I won&#39;t lose hope, and as someone interested in game design, I won&#39;t abandon my own ideas for what the ultimate horse game should look like, but for god&#39;s sake, give the weird horse girls and guys of the world something to look forward to.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a link to the presentation that inspired me to raise hell.

Before the POH update, 3rd age druidic pieces were able to be stored individually which made the item even more valuable for a UIM.\n\nAfter the POH update, 3rd age druidic became a set.  For UIM accounts, this means I am unable to withdraw the cloak until I complete the FULL druidic set. Druidic pieces only come from master clues, so this will never happen.\n\nUIM accounts now receive a WARNING when depositing items that they cannot withdraw until the related set is complete.  I had my cloak stored in my POH before the update.  I did NOT receive any warning this would happen -- the cloak was effectively consumed by my POH after the update landed.\n\nThe update mentioned reporting any lost items through the in game bug report mechanism, so that is what I did.  I gave it some time, but I have not heard back.  I sent an email yesterday to one of their support addresses, but I'm not hopeful about that avenue either.  I also don't want this to go unresolved for too long after the update.  The UIM community has been pushing me to elevate this, so I am posting here for visibility.\n\nI would love for a JMod to help me get my 3rd age cloak back.\n\nThanks,\nI can send a mod my RSN if needed\n\nEDIT:\n\nContext for those coming from /r/all:  I play a restricted game mode on Old School Runescape called Ultimate Ironman (UIM) where you can't store any items in a bank for later - you carry everything with you in your limited inventory to play the game.  You also can't trade other players and must earn everything yourself   \n\nIn the game, master treasure trails require end game items that many UIM find difficult to obtain and hold.  For context, completing 20 of them will land you on the front page of the highscores.  I got an incredibly rare item called the \"3rd age druidic cloak\" that you have a 1/313,168 chance to get from master treasure trails.  This item is worth more than the total value most accounts in the game hold.  \n\nUIM can't bank, but we can store certain items in wardrobes built in our Player Owned Houses (POH).  This was one of those items.  A recent update prevents me from withdrawing my rare item from my POH.  The update was such that I never received any warnings about this restriction before it happened. The Old School Runescape team will always respond to a post if the post gets over 3k upvotes. \n\nOld school RuneScape is a great game.

See also Dave's Task Manager's History on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNzszbnvQeFzObW0ghk0Ckw) \\]\n\nSome Task Manager lore: I'm the Microsoft (Redmond, '93) developer that wrote TaskMgr at home in my den in about 1994 and then the NT silverback devs let me check it into the main tree even though I was a greenhorn at the time.  So that meant I got to bring it into work and polish it up and make it an official part of Windows, where it remains to this day.  So I got to define my own day job, actually, which was nice!  I don't know if it's still like that, but great culture and people.\n\nThis is all based on XP, as I left long ago, but it's still the same core app underneath.  In no particular order:\n\n\\- If Task Manager ever hangs or crashes, start another by pressing ctrl-shift-esc.  Winlogon will look for an existing instance and try to revive it for up to 10 seconds.  If the old Taskmgr doesn't start making sense by responding with a secret code within that time, another one will be launched.  That way, you're never without a Taskmgr as long as there are some resources available.\n\n\\- Task Manager will load in reduced mode if resources are short, like only loading the Processes page if that's what's needed to get going.  It's one of the very few apps that won't just \"fail and bail\" when things go wrong.\n\n\\- If Task Manager ever becomes internally corrupted, kill/close it.  Restart it while holding down CTRL, ALT, and SHIFT, and Task Manager will reset ALL internal settings to factory fresh if it sees that key combo at startup.  Same works for every app I've written, btw, I think!\n\n\\- If all your titlebars disappear and you just have a graph, double-click dead client space to switch back to normal mode.  This no-titlebar mode is a mode I added to follow the NT clock, where you could remove borders as well, but it confused more people than it ever helped I'm sure!\n\n\\- I initially drew the meters as 7-segment LEDs but that wasn't localizable to all cultures (How do you do a right-to-left reading 7-segment LED for Saudi Arabia?) so they only lasted for one version or so.\n\n\\- CTRL-SHIFT-ESC will launch Taskmgr without any help from the Shell, so if the Shell/Explorer is dead use this key combo to bring up TM and then reset/restart the shell.  Even if your tray is missing and gone, this combo should start it.\n\n\\- If the shell can't start something or is hung, try Task Manager.  It has a mode where it will load without ANY references to the shell32.dll and allow you to start programs like CMD.EXE without the start menu.\n\n\\- You can find the binary for any executing process in the process table by right clicking and pick \"Show File Location\".  You can also search it online, but I don't know if they have useful info for much.\n\n\\- There should be nothing that TaskMgr can't kill - it will even escalate privilege and (if you have it) enable debug privilege to attach to and kill apps that way if needed.  If TM can't kill it, you've got a kernel problem.\n\n\\- A lot of people don't seem to know you can add many additional columns, remove others, drag them around to reorder, etc.\n\n\\- The reason there's a Window class called \"DavesFrameWndProc\" is because to get flicker-free resizing I needed group boxes to not try to paint on one another, so subclass them, give them their own wndproc, and enabling WS\\_CLIPSIBLINGS during WM\\_CREATE.  At least I think so!\n\n\\- TM is one of the apps I'm most proud of because it is probably the first or at least most visually complicated app to ever be fully resizable in all dimensions without any flicker up till then.  I was hardcore about memory and flicker in my day, so it was under 100K for the exe and never flashed or crashed, that was my thing!  Having the GDI32 and User32 guys down the hall sure helped.\n\nI also wrote/ported Space Cadet pinball, zip folders, worked on start menu, shell, calc, ole32, product activation, and some other stuff.  I was in MS-DOS before that but I doubt anyone is still supporting MS-DOS!\n\nEdit:  Looks like comments have been locked, so I'll update this one time with some answers to the most interesting/common questions below!\n\n\\- On the command line, I'm stumped, as I don't remember command line args to it at all!\n\n\\- On Space Cadet, yes, you can run it on Windows 10, but I doubt it's official or legal, so will point you at your favorite search engine for that one, but it's easy.  And on Space Cadet, reminder that Maxis did the very original (M. Ridgeway) and mine was just a rewrite in 32-bit portable C using their art.  That way it ran on the PowerPC, Alpha, and MIPS as well.

If you are still running Windows 7 with a LEGIT license, you can obtain a free upgrade to Windows 10 by using the [Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) from Microsoft. They have been very generous in continuing to allow users to upgrade from Windows 7 at no charge. *Do this upgrade AFTER your system has been cleaned of malware. A system image backup is highly recommended before starting this process. This backup can be performed to an external hard drive with the* [Backup & Restore tool](https://i.imgur.com/B0I3FgI.png) *located in the Control Panel on Windows 7 and up.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Purpose & Scope of this Guide:**\n\nThis guide is designed to assist you in removing malware from an infected system *that successfully boots*. If your computer is completely unable to boot due to malware, please make a post, as this guide will not help you. If you perform the following steps exactly as described, this will solve your problem in over 90% of scenarios. That said, not all malware is created equal, and not all malware removal tools are created equal. The tools recommended in this guide were picked because of their high success and low failure rates, measured on a very large scale. However, there will be times that this guide fails in removing malware. If that is the case, please make a post for further assistance, stating that this guide was unsuccessful. It is recommended to only accept advice from a \u201cTrusted\u201d technician. I am writing this guide in layman\u2019s terms so that most people will be able to understand it with ease.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nThe following instructions are recommendations only. You take full responsibility for any steps you choose to perform on your computer. While the following recommendations are performed without issue on countless machines, there is always a risk of damaging your Operating System or experiencing data loss on any machine. **It is solely YOUR responsibility to save all work and back up any and all important data on your system before proceeding.** \n\n\u00a0\n\n**Malware Remediation Steps:**\n\n*Before proceeding, go into your browser\u2019s extensions and remove all suspicious items. Also go into your browser\u2019s settings and remove any default search providers and unusual homepages. If you are unsure how to do this, proceed to Step 1.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Download and run the following tools in this order. Run all tools unless otherwise instructed. All tools should be run in Normal Mode (not Safe Mode) unless you are unable to boot Normal Mode, or the scans fail in Normal Mode. All tools must be run under an Administrator account. Do not remove any tool-generated logs in the event a helper needs you to post them to further assist you.*\n\n\u00a0\n\n**1) Run** [**rkill.com**](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/rkill/dl/10/)**. Sometimes it takes a few minutes to finish. Do not reboot when done.**\n\n* Kills running malicious processes\n* Removes policies in the registry that prevent normal OS operation\n* Repairs file extension hijacks\n\n\u00a0\n\n**2) Download an updated copy** [**Malwarebytes 4.0**](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/)**. Turn on the \u201c**[**Scan for Rootkits**](https://i.imgur.com/5lLJB3R.png)**\u201d option.

I recommend clicking \"Settings\" and uncheck \"Scan for tracking cookies\" before starting the scan. This will drastically reduce scan times. This tool can only be run ONCE for free. Use it wisely.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Please note:** If malware has prohibited you from browsing the web or downloading files, you can try running the [NetAdapter Repair Tool](http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/netadapter-repair-all-in-one/)  with [all options checked](http://i.imgur.com/XLv1ZUW.png) which will attempt to restore your internet connection & default browser settings. You may have to download these tools on another computer and move them to a flash drive that you can plug into the infected machine.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Think your Mac is infected?**\n\nTry [Malwarebytes Anti-Malware for Mac](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mac/). Please make a post if it is unsuccessful.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you have run all of the above tools successfully, you should be malware-free. If you are still experiencing problems, please make a post in /r/techsupport for further assistance.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Follow-up Steps (highly recommended):**\n\n* Using a computer that has not been infected, change passwords to all your online accounts.\n* Consider enabling two-factor authentication on all accounts!\n* Install a better anti-virus. See recommendations below.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**What is malware?**\n\n[Malware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware) is an umbrella term used to refer to a variety of forms of hostile or intrusive software, including computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, ransomware, spyware, adware, scareware, and other malicious programs. It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. \\[Source: Wikipedia.com\\]\n\n\u00a0\n\n**How did I get infected?**\n\nIt is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher\u2019s website directly.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**How to prevent future infections:**\n\nBe very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using [Ninite](http://ninite.com) for installing/updating software is very easy & safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.\n\n\u00a0\n\n**The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:**\n\n\u00a0\n\n**Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:**\n\n* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)\n* [BitDefender](http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html)\n* [ESET Free Online Scanner](http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/)\n\nFree AVs will only go so far. I highly recommend purchasing the AV of your choice to get better protection. Companies who offer products for free are usually making money off you one way or another. This has been [proven again recently with Avast](https://www.cnet.com/news/antivirus-firm-avast-is-reportedly-selling-users-web-browsing-data/). If you use Avast, uninstall it immediately.\n\n**Helpful Tools:**\n\n* [Malwarebytes 4.0](https://www.malwarebytes.org/mwb-download/) (Next-generation anti-virus replacement)\n* [uBlock Origin Browser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en) (Blocks ads)",

It can take the form of executable code, scripts, active content, and other software. [Source: Wikipedia.com]</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How did I get infected?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is difficult to track down the source of an infection. Most infections are actually given permission to run unknowingly by the user. It is recommended to keep User Account Control turned on and never give access to something you do not trust or did not open. Many other infections come via exploits in your browser or browser plug-ins on websites you visit. Always be very careful what you install. Make sure you trust the source implicitly. When downloading programs, always use the publisher\u2019s website directly.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to prevent future infections:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Be very careful what you download and install. Keep your software up-to-date. Using <a href=\"http://ninite.com\">Ninite</a> for installing/updating software is very easy &amp; safe and uses official installers without adding extra software to your PC during installation. Make sure Windows is kept up-to-date as well, including Windows 10 feature updates. Many Windows updates patch exploits and vulnerabilities in your operating system. Most infections are active because the user has unknowingly given it Administrative permission to install and run. The first line of defense starts with you.</p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>The following tools will aide you in keeping your computer clean:</strong></p>\n\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n\n<p><strong>Free Anti-Virus Suggestions:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/thankyou/\">Malwarebytes 4.0</a> (Next-generation anti-virus replacement, free version must be run MANUALLY)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/free.html\">BitDefender</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner/\">ESET Free Online Scanner</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Free AVs will only go so far.

I got my full speed on the other websites that were being throttled.\n\nA few days ago, they seem to have patched that, it no longer gives me full speed on all websites, except that Speedtest still has the full speed working.\n\nMy question is, what could be the workaround that they applied so that `Host` HTTP header would no longer be applied, while their Speedtest are still being whitelisted, getting the full speed.\n\nAnd is there anything I can do to fix that? Any ideas what could have changed so that I can working on it from there?\n\nThank you so much\n\n**Edit**:\n\nWow, I really was not expecting the post to get all of this interaction, there are some repeated comments sorry I will have to reply to here, because they are just too much for me to answer xD\n\n1. The reason I am trying to find a technical solution and not ask the company itself for help is, the company's customer support miserably sucks, people who have no idea about technology just send repeated messages like \"Restart the router, it is a general issue, it seems to me like you have full speed\", and I really will not get any help from them, as **they are INTENTIONALLY throttling my speed**.\n2. Testing through other speed testing websites like [fast.com](https://fast.com) & other websites, gives me 1/3 to 1/2 and sometimes even less than the speed I am subscribed to, although my line can handle 2x the speed I am subscribed to.\n3. Changing ISP is not an option for me, there is only 1 real ISP in the country, and all the others, you could maybe call resellers, all have the same rules, plans & prices. So I am trying to find a \"trick\", that can be done by me without having to go to them as this might be my only possibility of getting the speed I am subscribed to.\n\nI am very thankful & grateful for everyone trying to help, now since I don't really have any solutions in my head and there weren't many technical answers (tho I really do appreciate everyone taking time to answer), I will be replying in case there's something I can help you with, but for my shitty ISP, I will probably have to figure it out as some of you have suggested by looking into the Headers in case they have added new ones for verification.\n\nThank you one more time :D",

Make it work.\n\nTo answer another question you've been pestering us with: Yes, we *have* noticed all the local K12 school districts are going to be starting the school year online.

No, no we definitely won't be paying you more for the extra work you're doing.\n\nYes, this is probably your new normal workload moving forward if you're lucky enough to survive the Hunger Games machinations our CFO will be doing this fall.\n\nNo, we won't guarantee you won't be furloughed or fired anyway in two months.\n\nYes, this will put the Black and Latinx members of our community at risk since they're disproportionately represented on our environmental services staff.

The quiz had not even started. </p>\n\n<p>Since I had to take a 0 my quiz average dropped significantly (this is 1/3 of our grade).</p>\n\n<p>I went up to him after class (he let me in after the quiz) and he told me too bad, I should\u2019ve showed up at 7:59.</p>\n\n<p>I WAS ON TIME. I feel like this is incredibly unreasonable and I do not know what to do.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: emailed department chair, she basically talked to him and said that the quiz had already started so I need to go to his office hours and try and deal with it on my own. </p>\n\n<p>Edit: my final grade drops from an A- to a B+ (only 3 points - but still significant) </p>\n\n<p>Edit: appreciate the somewhat harsh feedback, I do need to be earlier. I literally show up like 7:57 every class and never have a problem. I just thought it was crazy to make my grade suffer when I was there at the stated time. But yes, I know how important timing is IRL</p>\n\n<p>To everyone saying I\u2019m clearly lying: I took this screenshot when I was standing outside showing my professor my phone. 8:00 on the dot: <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/tJnfWPn\">https://imgur.com/a/tJnfWPn</a></p>\n\n<p>Edit: I\u2019ve been banned from commenting</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->",

We took our final exam last thursday, and after that he asked if I wanted to have dinner with him to celebrate the last day of school. I told him that I couldn't because I had car racing practice that night. So he then asked me if he can watch me practice, and I said yeah.\n\nSo that night, he watched me drive lap after lap. Then after my practice when my coach left, sandwich guy asked me if he can try out my car. Typically, you need a racing license to drive a formula vee at my local track, but I wanted him to like me so I let him ride it. I taught him how to drive it and he loved it. It was so much fun!\n\nSo ever since then, we've been hanging out and going on dates. And as of last night, we're officially bf and gf now!
